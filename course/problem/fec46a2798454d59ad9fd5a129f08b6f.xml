        <p>Explanation</p>
        <p>Altering edX's built-in classes is a great example of a "fragile change." EdX has altered its layout and CSS in the past, and will no doubt continue to do so in the future, possibly without advance warning. While some classes are likely to be quite stable (such as the "sr" class used for screen-reader-only content), there's no guarantee.</p>
