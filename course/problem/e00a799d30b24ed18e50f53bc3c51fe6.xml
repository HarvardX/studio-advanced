    <h4 class="hx-underline">Part 1: Three Attempts per Problem</h4>
    <p>Consider the instructions for the SetMaxAttempts.py script.</p>
    <pre>
      <code class="lang-md">To use:
python3 SetMaxAttempts.py number path/to/problem/folder
Your options for the number are:
  - An actual number, which sets all problems to the same # of attempts
  - "delete" or "default", which removes the value so that
    course-wide default takes over
  - "auto" (recommended), in which case attempts are set as follows:
    - Numerical and Formula problems get 10
    - Customresponse and Text problems get 5
    - Checkbox problems get a number of attempts equal to the number of choices, max 5.
    - MC problems get...
      - 3 if they have 7+ options
      - 2 if they have 4-6 options
      - 1 if they have 2-3 options
    - Multi-problems get the highest number of the set.
    - Other problem types are skipped.
There will probably still be some issues, so you'll need to review.
    This code will help you make a first pass, not a final pass.</code>

      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Part 1:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>There are two correct methods on this list: setting the value using this script, or using this script to <em>remove</em> the value and then setting it in your course's Advanced Settings.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Part 2:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Because the script counts the total number of multiple-choice options in a problem, and this one has 7 or more (4 in part 1 and 5 in part 2), it will receive 3 attempts. This is one of the reasons you might want to review your course after running the script.</p>
