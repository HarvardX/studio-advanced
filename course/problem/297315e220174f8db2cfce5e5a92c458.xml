        <p>Explanation</p>
        <p>JSInput problems can only obtain the state for the <em>current user</em>, so you can't show your learner what <em>other users</em> entered. If you have a secure server, you could store things there, but you might be better off just iframing in an existing survey platform like SurveyMonkey, Google Forms, or Qualtrics.</p>
