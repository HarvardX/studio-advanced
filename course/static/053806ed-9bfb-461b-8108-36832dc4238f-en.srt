DREW LICHTENSTEIN: Hi.

1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,277
I'm Drew Lichtenstein.

2
00:00:05,277 --> 00:00:06,870
And I'm a course producer at HarvardX.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,570
And I'm here to talk to you about alternative navigation.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,570
So alternate navigation in edX is this ability

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,420
to kind of add custom navigation to a course.

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,420
You can give a course a more custom look that sets it apart from other courses.

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,170
It's particularly nice, because, as I'm sure you realize,

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,717
edX is a very linear progression through the course material

9
00:00:24,717 --> 00:00:27,300
if you just go through the outline or the horizontal bars that

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,620
are on the course pages.

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,547
And this alternative navigation lets learners see pathways

12
00:00:32,547 --> 00:00:35,130
through the material that is not necessarily just from A to B.

13
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,000
So you can connect things that maybe are in section one to section eight

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,860
that otherwise you could just do with edX's default look.

15
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:46,560
It's also nice, because you can expose the entire course layout on a page.

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,670
So right now, default edX look, you can only see that on the outline.

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,760
But you could put course navigation on a single page

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,160
that shows where everything is.

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,670
Also, you can add your own aesthetic touch.

20
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,340
You no longer are restricted to using edX's icons,

21
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,127
so those default video assessment icons within your course navigation.

22
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:10,710
And so there's a lot of different things you can do with this.

23
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,440
The downside is that you've to make sure that whatever you put in

24
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,995
continues to play nice with edX.

25
00:01:14,995 --> 00:01:18,120
You're putting in custom JavaScript, which means it could break at any time

26
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,230
when they update.

27
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,810
And so every time, you've got to kind of check.

28
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,750
Every couple weeks, make sure it's still there.

29
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,660
And also a lot of students who take edX courses

30
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,340
have taken previous edX courses.

31
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,750
So while edX's default navigation isn't great,

32
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,900
your students are probably used to using it, in which case

33
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,780
you want to make sure that the alternative navigation you put in

34
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,830
isn't confusing them.

35
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,815
I like to think of it more as supplemental navigation, that what

36
00:01:43,815 --> 00:01:45,690
you're putting in isn't meant to replace edX,

37
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,760
but it is meant to provide an enhancement on what's already there.

38
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,485
So be sure you're clear about what you're showing

39
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:52,860
with your alternative navigation.

40
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,820
And that way, you can avoid student confusion.
