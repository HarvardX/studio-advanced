COLIN FREDERICKS: Considering your design philosophy

1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,880
prior to building a course can save a lot of time in the long run.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,860
AMY WOODGATE: We've all had those, oh, if only I

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,455
had done that thing earlier moments when creating courses.

4
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:17,040
So this section is designed to encourage good practice reflections

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,600
during the planning stage.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,065
COLIN FREDERICKS: Prior to creating content on the platform.

7
00:00:21,065 --> 00:00:23,190
AMY WOODGATE: This section's main focus is on features

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,760
that need careful consideration and justification at the design

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,760
stage as the implications for build can be vast

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,230
if not properly thought through.

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,480
COLIN FREDERICKS: These features are notoriously difficult

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,970
or time consuming to build, let alone edit once on the platform.

13
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,142
So the design planning stage is crucial.

14
00:00:39,142 --> 00:00:41,100
AMY WOODGATE: However, these are also the features

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,740
often mooted at design sessions as something fun

16
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,892
or interestingly different.

17
00:00:44,892 --> 00:00:47,850
COLIN FREDERICKS: In this section, we will not only provide you with the tools

18
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,830
to build these but also to say no and justify why.
