00:00:03,825 --> 00:00:05,700
AMY WOODGATE: Quite a lot of this course focuses

1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,330
on straightforward implementation and improved operating procedures.

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,780
COLIN FREDERICKS: This section is the hard stuff, and it needs to be that way.

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,290
AMY WOODGATE: Many of these longer projects require a massive upfront investment

4
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:20,190
in different areas, such as learning the code, setup requirements,

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,410
understanding specific nuances of the platform,

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,490
and last but not least, planning out the whole endeavor.

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,220
COLIN FREDERICKS: We're not trying to put you off using these features.

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,100
We just want you to understand that they are not easy or quick,

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,410
and they require a lot of careful thought and planning.

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,160
AMY WOODGATE: So the next time someone says--

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,535
COLIN FREDERICKS: I've got a great idea.

12
00:00:37,535 --> 00:00:39,150
Let's make the course adaptive.

13
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,430
AMY WOODGATE: You at least will know what that actually

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,680
means for cost development and so can make a well-informed decision.
