00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,870
COLIN FREDERICKS: So you've managed to cordon off an entire afternoon

1
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,940
to yourself just to work on your class.

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,220
AMY WOODGATE: No meetings, no interruptions.

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,250
Lucky you.

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,940
Now what?

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,690
COLIN FREDERICKS: Well, you could do something

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,773
where you need to comb through your entire course,

7
00:00:17,773 --> 00:00:19,890
like converting all your images to figures,

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,690
things that add a professional touch.

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,710
AMY WOODGATE: You could do something that

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,200
requires a bit more planning, like writing a survey

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,462
or setting up learner cohorts.

12
00:00:26,462 --> 00:00:28,170
COLIN FREDERICKS: You could also do something

13
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,910
that might require stretching your skills

14
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,660
and doing a little bit of troubleshooting,

15
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,200
like batch processing your course with Python.

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,360
AMY WOODGATE: We should get started before we run out of afternoon.

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,318
COLIN FREDERICKS: Oh, yeah.

18
00:00:37,318 --> 00:00:38,460
[LAUGHS]
