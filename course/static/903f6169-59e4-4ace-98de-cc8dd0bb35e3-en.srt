00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:06,670
AMY WOODGATE: There are some improvements you just can't make in a few minutes.

1
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,412
COLIN FREDERICKS: Or in a day or a week.

2
00:00:08,412 --> 00:00:10,120
There are things you need to do as a part

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,290
of your regular course-building practice.

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,185
AMY WOODGATE: For example, if you write clean HTML from the beginning,

5
00:00:15,185 --> 00:00:16,560
you'll never have to clean it up.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,940
COLIN FREDERICKS: And neither will the person who works on the course after you.

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,150
AMY WOODGATE: The goal is to do a hill of work now to avoid a mountain of work

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:22,887
later.

9
00:00:22,887 --> 00:00:25,720
COLIN FREDERICKS: This section doesn't really have projects in the same way

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,740
that the others do.

11
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,032
AMY WOODGATE: Instead, we're going to propose some changes

12
00:00:29,032 --> 00:00:31,120
to your workflow that will make you more efficient

13
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,680
or make your course more beautiful.

14
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,097
COLIN FREDERICKS: It's a lot of work to change how you do things,

15
00:00:35,097 --> 00:00:39,270
but we promise these new approaches are definitely worth the effort.
