SHILPA IDNANI: Hello, my name is Shilpa Idnani.

1
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,580
I am a program manager at the MIT Office of Open Learning.

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,030
Previously, I was at HarvardX, where I was an instructional technologist

3
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,155
and tasked with a wide variety of technical tasks across courses.

4
00:00:17,155 --> 00:00:19,030
One of the things that I was often told to do

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,707
was to change the settings on a set of videos

6
00:00:22,707 --> 00:00:24,790
or change the settings on every single assessment,

7
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:29,410
due to a procedural change, a process change, or an organizational change.

8
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,610
Now you want to change something very precise,

9
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:36,310
something like video downloading, video transcription, the number

10
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,000
of attempts on a problem.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,480
Maybe you want to change the specific terminology

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,350
or replace a link in a bunch of your HTML components.

13
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,650
How do you do this?

14
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,460
Well, the easiest way to do this is to download your course,

15
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,100
unzip it, and process it either in Python

16
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,920
or even a text editor with a multi file Find and Replace feature, and then

17
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,710
re-zip it and put it back up on your platform.

18
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,690
Why would you want to do something so crazy?

19
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,480
Playing with XML is very, very dangerous.

20
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,690
The reason you want to do this is because you often

21
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,700
need to do things within a deadline.

22
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,690
So somebody has to make sure that this course has this change

23
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,610
and you've got three days to do it.

24
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,050
Three days is probably just enough time to manage 160 videos in a course

25
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,360
and make them all downloadable and make sure all your work is done correctly.

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,960
However, using this batched process method,

27
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,420
you can actually do this within five minutes.

28
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,125
It saves you a tremendous amount of time.

29
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:34,250
The other reason why you might want to do this is an organizational change.

30
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,320
So say procedures have changed.

31
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,830
We're changing the IP rules around our property.

32
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,950
Making a video downloadable or not downloadable

33
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,690
is something that you can also do.

34
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,390
Just go and find the variable that you would like to modify

35
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,700
and make sure you replace the term that you need.
