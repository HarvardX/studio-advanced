DUSTIN TINGLEY: Hi.

1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,685
My name's Dustin Tingley, and I'm a Professor

2
00:00:06,685 --> 00:00:08,640
of Government at Harvard University.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,730
I'm also the Deputy Vice Provost for Advances in Learning.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,710
As part of that role, I run a team that embeds surveys in HarvardX courses.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,650
Today, we're going to talk very briefly about some things

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,760
that we find to be very important that you probably already know, too,

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,580
but I just want to take a second to reinforce.

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:33,210
So one of the biggest things to remember about running surveys in a course

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,740
is that you only get one shot.

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,278
You can't go back to a survey respondent and say, hey,

11
00:00:38,278 --> 00:00:40,320
can you please take this survey again because I'd

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,590
like to ask you this question slightly differently than the way you first

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,340
took it?

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,050
Doesn't work.

15
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,240
Pilot, pilot, pilot, pilot.

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,980
Have other people take the survey such that you can reduce the chance that you

17
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,887
want to change something later.

18
00:00:54,887 --> 00:00:57,720
Have your friends take the survey, have your family take the survey,

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,180
have your boss take the survey, have other course

20
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,640
designers take the survey, et cetera.

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,310
It really, really helps.

22
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,970
Next, let's think about the quality of the data

23
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,810
that you're able to collect as a function of the amount of time

24
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,650
it takes a survey respondent to take your survey.

25
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,440
Anything longer than around 10 minutes, you're

26
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,390
probably facing a dramatic decline in the quality of data.

27
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,660
So when your boss comes to you and asks for hey,

28
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:34,230
let's add these 15 other questions onto the survey, remind them we can do that,

29
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:38,070
but that might decrease the quality of the data.

30
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,870
Then I think it's really important for us to think about the survey taker

31
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,090
and what their experience is.

32
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,270
Anything longer than 10 minutes, the quality of the data

33
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,550
is going to go down.

34
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:59,110
People get bored taking surveys that have lots and lots of text on a screen.

35
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,740
So how do you minimize that?

36
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,190
Keep the questions short and punchy.

37
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:10,313
Emphasize things using underlining or bold fonting

38
00:02:10,313 --> 00:02:12,480
in order to really get the message across about what

39
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,070
it is that you're asking.

40
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,690
Furthermore, minimize the number of questions on a page.

41
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,550
Introduce page breaks between questions, such

42
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,120
that you're not confronting someone with a wall of text.

43
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,410
Branching questions are oftentimes used also to help reduce fatigue.

44
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,810
A branching question lets you ask, hey, here are two choices

45
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,720
and depending on how you answer amongst those,

46
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,360
I'm going to give you a slightly different question.

47
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,120
Branching questions help to reduce the amount of text

48
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,650
that needs to be on the page.

49
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,520
Finally, and this is a little pro trick, keep in mind

50
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,820
that many people might take your survey on a mobile phone.

51
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,220
So that means you need to check how your survey looks on a mobile phone.

52
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,990
That's really easy to do.

53
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,110
Take your survey on a mobile phone.

54
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,320
Finally, I just want to point out that I too often see

55
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,970
people in many different areas of industry and academia

56
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:13,540
running surveys and then rarely really analyzing the data.

57
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,290
It's as if they wanted the data, but not the insight

58
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,860
and the analysis that is possible from running one of these surveys.

59
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,930
So if you're asking your learners to take the time to answer your survey,

60
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,080
you should take the time to analyze it and think

61
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,220
about how you can make a better course using the information that they've

62
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,400
provided you.

63
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,430
Thank you very much.
