Amy: Automatic allocation for cohorts is pretty straightforward.

1
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,340
First, go to the Instructor Dashboard in the Live view of your course.

2
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,970
Then click Cohorts, and tick the Enable Cohorts button.

3
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,260
This brings up a new button prompting to add cohorts.

4
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,570
Now, in this example, we know we want to make

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,710
three cohorts named A, B, and C. So let's start with cohort A.

6
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,530
We know we want users to be automatically allocated

7
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,080
so that when people join the course, they're randomly assigned to a cohort.

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,820
And we know we don't need any specific content to be displayed.

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,400
Once happy with the settings, press Submit.

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,990
Then repeat until all cohorts are set up.

11
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:49,610
Remember, once a name is used for your cohort, you can't change or delete it.

12
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,150
So make sure you are happy with everything on this page

13
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,280
before you press Submit.

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,450
As these are automatic allocations, for as long as this box is ticked,

15
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,870
users will be assigned to a cohort the minute the course goes live

16
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,640
and they access the site.

17
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,650
If you change your mind on cohorts before the course goes live,

18
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,240
you can always come back to this button and untick the selection.

19
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,610
At this stage, you're now ready to go.

20
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:17,290
Now, hypothetically, if we were to need specific cohort views or experiment

21
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,860
group configurations for research purposes, you can tick here,

22
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,010
and it will take you to Group Configurations in Studio.

23
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:28,180
You can also access this via Settings then Group Configuration in Studio

24
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,730
on the top navigation bar.

25
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:35,600
Finally, if you were to need to change a user's cohort allocation at any time,

26
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,830
you can simply select the Required New Cohort from the dropdown

27
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:42,040
and add the user's email address in the box below.

28
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,830
This will override any previous allocation, however, and

29
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:49,030
is pretty risky if the course is already live, as their previous submissions may

30
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,760
be affected.
