Colin: This is a quick demo of the bridge for adaptivity in action.

1
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,080
I've got the course outline open here, and I'm

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,660
going to dive in to this particular section that you're indexing.

3
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,270
The page loads.

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,400
We've got a video on top of the professor,

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,960
and underneath it is our adaptive assignment.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,740
The top left is the problem number.

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,040
I haven't done any so far, so it's just problem one.

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,650
The top right is the earned grade.

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,020
Here it actually has a number in it, because I've

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,320
done some related problems elsewhere in the course.

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,410
I'm going to read the question.

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,580
OK, I'm going to answer that, and I submit.

13
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,850
And I am correct.

14
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,220
Excellent.

15
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,170
So now I'm going to hit the Next button, and the bridge

16
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,560
read activity will give me another question.

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,210
Might be on the same topic or a related one or it could be a new question.

18
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,600
And I'll just go ahead and answer this one.

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,890
Good, OK, and I can check the answer just like any other EdX problem,

20
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,360
because it really is an EdX problem.

21
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,350
A little bit later on problem three, the more questions I answer

22
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,840
right, the higher my grade goes.

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,730
If I answer wrong, grade goes down.

24
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,258
You can see that this problem is going to be a bit harder than my last one.

25
00:01:20,258 --> 00:01:22,300
When I'm happy with the grade for this assignment

26
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,430
or if I just run out of problems, I can move on to the next page.
