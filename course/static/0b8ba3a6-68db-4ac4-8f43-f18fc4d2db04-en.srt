COLIN FREDERICKS: Sometimes a few little tweaks are all

1
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,428
you need to make a course stand out.

2
00:00:07,428 --> 00:00:09,720
Of course, you always want to have attention to detail.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,570
AMY WOODGATE: A consistent page style and good proofreading

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,430
should, of course, be your first priority.

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,800
But once that's sorted, you can move on and put in some fun touches.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,550
COLIN FREDERICKS: And those don't have to take forever to make an impact.

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,350
The examples we feature in this section are

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,560
quick to set up and provide diversity to your tool selection.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,830
AMY WOODGATE: Many of those, if only I could do x or y, moments,

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,560
can be easily rectified through adding advance activity

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,170
types in global settings, and some require

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,262
creative use of existing functions.

13
00:00:36,262 --> 00:00:36,970
COLIN FREDERICKS: Hacks.

14
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,010
We mean hacks.

15
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,180
AMY WOODGATE: Some of them are definitely hacks.

16
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,120
COLIN FREDERICKS: It's a nice way to ease yourself into course creativity.

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,490
These examples are short, pretty easy to set up--

18
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,240
AMY WOODGATE: And hopefully good fun to give you the development bug.

19
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,790
Enjoy.
