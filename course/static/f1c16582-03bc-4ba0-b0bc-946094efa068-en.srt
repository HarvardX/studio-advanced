ANDREW ANG: Hi, I'm Andrew Ang.

1
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,090
I'm a data engineer with Harvard's Vise Provost

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,520
for Advances and Learning Research group, where

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,990
we harness data to research and improve the educational experience, both online

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,270
and here on campus.

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,520
One particular area of interest for us is adaptive and personalized learning.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,880
Online courses offer an unprecedented opportunity

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,400
to reach learners all over the world at scale.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,220
To reach learners that may not have the opportunity

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,130
given their location or circumstances.

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,620
Our research has shown that learners in online courses

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,270
come from all walks of life, with different backgrounds, ages, education

12
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,470
levels, domain experience, and come with different motivations and goals

13
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,640
for what they want to get out of the course.

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,990
It's hard to imagine a one size fits all approach being optimal

15
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,780
for every single one of these diverse learners.

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,370
That's where adaptivity can help.

17
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,620
So what exactly do we mean by adaptivity?

18
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,080
There in a lot of ways that a learning experience can be adaptive.

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,940
For example, instead of a typical quiz where every learner sees the same 10

20
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:13,982
questions, imagine a quiz where learners instead see one question at a time.

21
00:01:13,982 --> 00:01:15,690
They have to answer the previous question

22
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,890
before moving on to the next one.

23
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,050
We customize the topic and difficulty of the question they see next

24
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,380
based on their previous answers.

25
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,130
Each learner will get a different sequence

26
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,460
of questions that is exactly tailored to their particular needs.

27
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,120
The idea is to constantly measure the student's knowledge

28
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,230
levels of each topic and to serve them questions in a smart way,

29
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,780
with the goal of maximizing the students' knowledge

30
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,820
level for all of those relevant topics that we are tracking.

31
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,670
That sounds idealistic, but it is actually quite possible

32
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,990
to integrate into your ethics course.

33
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,920
Here are some things to think about before embarking on this approach.

34
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,390
First, you have to define a set of topics, or as we call them,

35
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,350
knowledge components, that your course materials address.

36
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,100
Second, you'll have to develop a lot more material in order

37
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,850
for an adaptive system to address the needs of particular learners.

38
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,730
It has to have a large collection of differentiated materials

39
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,730
that adaptive system can choose from.

40
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,610
Third, you have to tag each individual piece

41
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,630
of material with one or more knowledge components, and ideally, difficulty

42
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,710
as well.

43
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,040
Finally, the edX platform doesn't support

44
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,748
this kind of functionality natively, so you'll

45
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:30,540
need to install a tool like the open source

46
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,560
system we've developed to handle the contents, metadata, Knowledge

47
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,930
Tracing, and the user interface.

48
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,480
It's a lot of work.

49
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,240
You'll need to decide whether it's worth the payoff of offering

50
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,120
a more engaging and personalized learning experience for your learners.
