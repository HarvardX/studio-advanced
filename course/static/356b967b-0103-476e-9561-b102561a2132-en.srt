COLIN FREDERICKS: Are we good?

1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,940
Are we rolling?

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,440
Oh, OK.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,100
We're rolling.

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,840
Awesome.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,970
Why did we decide to do all the filming in one day?

6
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,220
AMY WOODGATE: I have no idea.

7
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,107
I'm shattered.

8
00:00:15,107 --> 00:00:16,190
We meant to say thank you.

9
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,107
COLIN FREDERICKS: Oh yes.

10
00:00:17,107 --> 00:00:17,650
Thank you.

00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,490
Thank you to--

12
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,560
OK, let's see.

13
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,730
Fred, who's our video--

14
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,160
Fred, come over and say hi to people.

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,940
FRED: No, I don't want to be on camera.

16
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,060
COLIN FREDERICKS: OK, Fred's awesome.

17
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,070
He's our video editor.

18
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,370
He put all this stuff together.

19
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,097
He's great.

20
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:33,680
AMY WOODGATE: We've got our speakers.

21
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,930
COLIN FREDERICKS: Oh, yeah, yeah.

22
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:40,250
So Shilpa, Drew, Dustin, and Andrew, thank

23
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,590
you so much for helping out with this.

24
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,295
We couldn't have done this without you.

25
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:45,920
AMY WOODGATE: And thanks, 'Col'

26
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,730
COLIN FREDERICKS: Thank you.

27
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:47,500
Oh, and Shelley.

28
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,700
Shelley from MIT, who wrote some of the sections.

29
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,010
AMY WOODGATE: Absolutely.

30
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,330
COLIN FREDERICKS: And HarvardX for helping us

31
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,360
put all this together and for funding all this.

32
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,510
It's been wonderful.
