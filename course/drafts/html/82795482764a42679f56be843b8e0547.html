  <p>The poll and survey components on this page are literally the same ones from the course outline, so if you answered them there, you answered them here too! We used XBlock URLs to pull them from this page, and iframe them into the first course update. If you've just got to see how that's done right away, check out the page on <a href="/jump_to_id/c14dedcf9bf34effb28e2242675f6053" target="_blank">XBlock URLs</a>. Or just click "Next" to move on as per normal.</p>
