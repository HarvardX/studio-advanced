<p>As mentioned previously, the setup for cohorts is pretty logical but it does require each step to be approached in sequential order. If you try and do things in a different order, the platform will simply say no! EdX has limited error messages, and you might not be able to figure out exactly where you went wrong.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Whilst quite a lot of this could be tackled through trial and error, we have put together a neat flow chart to guide you through the process, with all its nuances and intricacies. That being said, whilst there are a lot of steps, each step is pretty gosh-darn quick to complete, so the whole process can be finished in a matter of minutes (providing you know which configurations you&rsquo;re after).</p>
<p></p>
<p>In reality, the thing that takes the most time is chasing people to sign up to the platform and course, when using manual allocation - automatic allocations require minimal setup time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We will go into more detail about the why and when of &lsquo;setting up content experiments&rsquo; in another section. This section is designed to help you better understand all the configuration options available should you wish or need to use them.</p>

<p>The cohort setup flowchart, with a lot more detail at each step, is available to view via the link on image or <a href="/static/Cohort_flow__1_.pdf" target="_blank">download</a>.</p>

  <h4><span class="fa fa-check"></span> Tip: Studio Warnings</h4>
  <p>Have a play around in studio and try to do things in a different order. You&rsquo;ll see the platform has some useful warning buttons to help you along the way.</p>
