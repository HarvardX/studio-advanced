<p>Landing pages can be changed quickly but often need a bit of trial and error to get exactly right. Updates on the edX platform have a limited width - they do not span the full width of the browser, closer to 60%, and are not the most responsive. All these variables need to be taken into consideration when planning out your page.</p>
<p>Simplicity is key - as with all platforms, reducing clutter on pages improves user experience.</p>
<p>Think about the main messages first - what is it you need or want to communicate? What is the purpose of the landing page for this specific course? Then plan it out - maybe sketch out the ideal layout.</p>

<h4 class="hx-underline">Key points to consider</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Be careful with too much formatting diversity - float left, float right, and central aligned images can look great at one screen width but awful on another. Use containers where possible but be mindful of the implications of too many images with too little text to fill and wrap in the space.</li>
  <li>You can not override a user’s preference to close the update - you can set it to show multiple times but if they press the little x, it will not display again. Make sure important information is held elsewhere in the course structure.</li>
  <li>Don't go feature  and formatting crazy - the last thing you want to do is break edX navigation! See <a href="/jump_to_id/7f50b8142bf5405d90864ce6c60537a9" target="_blank">2.2 Tone Back the CSS</a>.</li>
  <li>It can be tempting to put loads of stuff in this area. BE WARNED. If a user can not see the course outline easily, they may wonder how to actually start the course! Linking to the first content page within the update text or keeping the update short will help to alleviate these issues.</li>
</ol>

<p>A nice continuity point - the course image. Once a user signs up to a course, they only see the course image in their course dashboard. This can be a really easy way to add colour to your landing page and continuity from dashboard to learning experience. Add your image to ‘files and uploads’ then use the studio url for the image file.</p>
<p>A little 'cheat' - if you're not confident using a raw HTML editor, experiment on a text component in the course and copy across your HTML from there.</p>
