<p>Interactives (definition):</p>
<blockquote>Learning components that encourage self-directed study through a requirement on the learner to engage with the materials in an active way, e.g. to move something, click or enter an answer on screen. Sometimes these activities include a series of dependencies, only showing the next piece of content once a previous action has been logged. Typically, the technology is designed to give a sense of the tutor guiding a learner through the materials, without the tutor needing to be physically present.

<p>There is a lot of pedagogical research that states active engagement with diverse learning materials improves information retention, and interactive elements are often highly rated by users for tackling complex concepts in a more visual and hands-on way. But applied learning activities needn’t take ages to build, nor always be super-duper glossy. Often, simplicity is key.</p>

<p>Being realistic, not everyone who studies on your course will do every activity or read every line. You must keep this in mind at the design phase. Ask yourself: “is the complex build worth it if only 10% of learners engage with the activity?” Sometimes, even asking this explicitly during the design phase can be useful to manage expectations. </p>

<p>In all cases, consider first the problem or challenge you are trying to solve (start with ‘why’) then consider whether basic building blocks, such as MCQs, could provide a simple interactive solution; if not possible to use basic solutions, and deemed valuable enough an activity to put in more effort, consider the next tier of complexity, then the next, until you are one step away from saying yes to an adaptive design (then stop and run away!) ;)</p>
