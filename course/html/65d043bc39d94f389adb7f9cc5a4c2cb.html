<p>For example, here's what the different elements would look like in the component editor:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[x] a correct muliple selection checkbox answer {{ selected: feedback will be shown }, { unselected: different feedback will be shown }}</p>
<p>[ ] an incorrect multiple selection checkbox answer</p>

<p>( ) an incorrect answer {{ if you add feedback on single choice questions, remember only one hint will show }}</p>
<p>(x) a correct answer</p>

<p>= 100 +-5 {{ the tolerance means you could answer 95 &gt; 105 and still get a point }}</p>

<p>||Hint 1 will display first when the hint icon is clicked at any point of your question engagement||</p>
<p>||Hint 2 likewise will only show when you click the hint icon in the bottom right corner||</p>
