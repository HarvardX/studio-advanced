<p>You might have learned how to <a href="/jump_to_id/9a8299914e364827bef20023b7bf2583" target="_blank">select the problem types that are best for your course</a> already. But what if you really need something that's not already covered? Maybe you have a great idea for an authentic assessment or activity and you'd like to have it graded. What then?</p>

<p>If you have access to your edX server, you can <a href="https://github.com/edx/xblock-sdk" target="_blank">write an XBlock</a>, but a)&nbsp;not all of us have that access, and b)&nbsp;sometimes an XBlock is overkill. Instead, you might want a <a href="https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-partner-course-staff/en/latest/exercises_tools/custom_javascript.html" target="_blank">Custom Javascript Display and Input Problem</a> (also known as a JSInput Problem). The official documentation is good, but we're going to walk through a few implications and key points that will let you create one with more confidence and with a better idea of this problem type's capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>The goal:</strong> Write a custom javascript problem.<br/>
  <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> HTML, CSS, and Javascript.<br/>
  <strong>Project length:</strong> At least a day to build and test.<br/>
  <strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
  <ul class="hx-tightlist">
    <li>If you have existing resources that you want to use - graphics, Javascript libraries, etc. - you should get those together first.</li>
    <li>We're going to refer to sample code from Stanford's <a href="https://github.com/Stanford-Online/js-input-samples/" target="_blank">JSInput Repository</a> at GitHub.</li>
