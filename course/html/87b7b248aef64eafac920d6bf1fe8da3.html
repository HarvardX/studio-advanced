<h4 class="hx-underline">Top tips from Dustin</h4>
<ul>
  <li>You only get one shot - you can't ask people again </li>
  <li>Pilot, pilot, pilot - others may spot something you didn't</li>
  <li>Keep the survey short - longer than 10 minutes, people get bored and the quality of data reduces</li>
  <li>Keep the sections short - minimise the number of questions on a page
  <li>Keep the questions short - consider branching questions for multiple options</li>
  <li>Check out the user experience on a mobile phone </li>
  <li>Only collect data you are willing to analyse - why ask a question if you're not interested in the insights?!</li>
