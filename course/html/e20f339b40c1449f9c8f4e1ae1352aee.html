<p>Basic question types on edX - multiple choice questions (MCQ), open text and open numerical input questions - often get a lot of bad press. They can be seen as boring or too limited to do anything interesting with, which is completely untrue! Basic questions can be powerful tools for assessment creativity, reflection prompts, and also help reinforce a sense of ‘tutor at scale’ through the use of hints and feedback. What’s more, you can randomise questions and set numerical tolerances in answers, which suddenly doesn’t make them sound all that basic at all!
