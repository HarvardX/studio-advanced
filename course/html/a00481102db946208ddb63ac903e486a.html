<h3 class="hx-underline">Encouraging Academic Honesty</h3>

<p>Now that you know how people cheat, let's look at how you can at least slow them down. We'll start with two non-technical methods.</p>

<h3 class="hx-underline"><span aria-label="medal emoji">&#129351;</span> Honor codes</h3>

<p>Sure, why not. The <a href="https://www.edx.org/edx-terms-service#honor-code" target="_blank">edX honor code</a> is a good start.</p>

<p>It's never <em>bad</em> to have an honor code, but they're a bit like the Terms of Service. No one's reading them, and they're only used for enforcement after the fact - and even then, rarely. Research indicates that they lead to "<a href="http://cutrell.org/papers/corrigan-gibbs-2015-TOCHI-DeterringCheatingOnline.pdf" target="_blank">a small and insignificant reduction in online cheating behaviors</a>." So yes, you should have one, and no, you should not imagine that it will make a difference.</p>

<h3 class="hx-underline"><span aria-label="mostly sunny emoji">&#127780;</span> Lower the stakes</h3>

<p>A lot of cheating happens because people feel stressed and want a way out. They feel like they can't succeed without cheating.</p>

<p>Final exams, midterms, final essays, and other high-stakes events all contribute to this. They're high-stress events without much analogue in real life. Simply splitting up your exams and spreading out the assessments through your course can reduce stress, increase reading rates, and improve course evaluations too.
