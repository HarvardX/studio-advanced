<h3 class="hx-underline">Bug Fixes Never End</h3>

<p>An online class, even one that's "finished", is still a living thing that requires work and attention.</p>

<h4 class="hx-underline" id="track_issues"><span class="fa fa-bug"></span> Track Issues</h4>

<p>It's good to know when there's a problem, but you don't want everyone to e-mail you multiple times for every problem. Instead, set up a simple bug-tracking system, like using an <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RIRcXN_uwC20-D6qSLtUqe1rUwsffTgGEWnYZpxna4U/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Issue Tracker</a> Google Spreadsheet. (Feel free to make a copy of our sheet for your own use.) We also recommend setting up <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/91588?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en" target="_blank">Notification Rules</a> within the spreadsheet to e-mail you every day if there are changes made. Give your Community TAs and other staff access to this spreadsheet and you'll have a solid record of what's been done in the course.</p>

<h4 class="hx-underline"><span class="fa fa-bomb"></span> So You Wrote A Broken Problem.</h4>

<p>It's ok. Everyone does it.</p>

<p><em>Everyone.</em></p>

<p>Luckily, edX has much better tools to handle this now than they did in the early days. It used to be that you needed to zero out the credit for the problem so that no one's grade would be hurt by a poorly-written exercise. Now, however, you have the option of selecting <a href="https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/open-edx-ca/en/latest/student_progress/course_grades.html#rescore-an-individual-learner-s-submission-only-if-the-score-improves" target="_blank">Rescore Only If Score Improves</a>, which is <em>absolutely the right way to do things.</em> Don't go around setting points for individual learners or giving extensions or really handling <em>anything</em> in a MOOC on a case-by-case basis. Fix the problem, and use <a href="https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/open-edx-ca/en/latest/student_progress/course_grades.html#rescore-an-individual-learner-s-submission-only-if-the-score-improves" target="_blank">Rescore Only If Score Improves</a>. Everyone who answered correctly will now get points, and no one will lose points.</p>

<p>Avoid changing the order of answers in your MC, dropdown, and checkbox questions, since learner answers are linked to a specific item in the list and not to the text of that item.</p>
