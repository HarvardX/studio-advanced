<p>EdX has a number of advanced settings, most of which are not well-documented or are listed across multiple pages. Here we're collecting all of the information about the Advanced Settings page in one place.</p>

<p>As the warning says, "Do not modify these policies unless you are familiar with their purpose." If you're going to test out variations on these settings, have a backup of your course ready and have the Import page loaded, just in case you make Studio unusable and need to restore.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> None.<br/>
  <strong>Project length:</strong> 20 minutes to select and change settings, 10 minutes to test.<br/>
  <strong>Ingredients:</strong> None. Anyone with access to Studio can do this.</p>
