<h3 class="hx-underline">Alternative Uses</h3>

<p>The code we provided will pop up arbitrary HTML. What else can you do with that? Well, it's a little bit limited by the amount of time you have. The links are only present for five seconds. However, in five seconds you can still...</p>

<ul>
  <li>Show a simple graph illustrating the professor's comments.</li>
  <li>Show a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locator_map" target="_blank">locator map</a> to indicate a country or province.</li>
  <li>When the professor refers to an equation, show that equation for a moment. <a href="https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-partner-course-staff/en/latest/exercises_tools/mathjax.html" target="_blank">MathJax</a> works just fine in these links.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this could be done in video edits as well, but the advantage here is that you can <em>also</em> make it a link! We encourage you to be consistent throughout your videos. For instance, if you're using it for graphs, use the same type of graph over and over again. Popping up a <em>new</em> type of graph might not give learners enough time to absorb it in five seconds. They can always pause the video, but not everyone thinks of that at the time.</p>

<p>In addition, if you love bad ideas, you could...</p>

<ul>
  <li>Block the whole video with a huge opaque black image.</li>
  <li>Dig up facepalm.gif to add snarky commentary about your videos.</li>
  <li>Pop up another, smaller iframed video!</li>
</ul>
