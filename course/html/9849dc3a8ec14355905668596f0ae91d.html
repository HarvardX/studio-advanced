<p>Surveys, or more specifically online questionnaires, can be powerful tools to gain better understanding of your learners. Setting them up is straightforward, providing you know what insights you wish to gain in advance. You also need to think about whether connecting answers with a learner’s profile vs. anonymity is important, as this will have the biggest impact on how you set up the survey. </p>

<p>Most importantly, you need to think about *why* you are asking the question(s) and what value the learner will get from participating.</p>

<p>Remember, planning is vital - once the survey is live, there’s no going back!
