<h3 class="hx-underline">How do people cheat?</h3>

<p>And what can you do about it?</p>

<div class="hx-bluebox hx-sidebar">
  <h4>What about looking things up?</h4>
  <p>We're not going to include "looking things up online" in our definition of cheating for an online course. Google is <em>right there, all the time</em>. Asking people not to use it would be like asking people in a math quiz not to count on their fingers.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="hx-underline">Asking for Answers</h4>

<p>Some people directly ask for the answers to questions. When this happens on the edX discussion forum, having active forum moderators who <strong>enforce your forum guidelines</strong> is your best approach. Your guidelines should be very clear about where the line is between collaboration and cheating. You can click below to see one set of guidelines if you'd like a starting point.</p>

  <h4>Example Collaboration Guidelines</h4>
  
  <p>This set of guidelines was made for an instructor-paced course with regularly spaced assignments. You should adjust it for your own course as needed.</p>
    
    <hr/>
  
<p>We encourage class participants to collaborate on assignments!  But be sure you learn how to do the assignments yourself, and please do not post solutions to discussion forums until after the due date. Staff will proactively remove solutions posted before due dates.</p>

<ul>
    <li>It <em>is</em> OK to discuss or work jointly to develop a general approach to an assignment.</li>
    <li>It <em>is</em> OK to get a hint from peers or course staff if you get stuck on an assignment.</li>
    <li>You should work out the details of assignments yourself.</li>
    <li>It is <em>not</em> OK to copy someone else's solution.</li>
    <li>It is <em>not</em> OK to take someone else's formula and plug in your own numbers to get the answer.</li>
    <li>It is <em>not</em> OK to post answers to a problem.</li>
    <li>It is <em>not</em> OK to look at a full step-by-step solution for the purpose of submitting an answer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes you can even find the answers to an entire course online. For example, we know there used to be an entire astronomy course on Coursera where every question had been asked and answered on Quora. The people answering might not have even known they were helping someone cheat on their homework. If you're curious as to whether someone has done this for your course, just take the entire text of your problems and past them into a search engine. Most people aren't being very sneaky. Realistically, there's nothing you can do about this.</p>

<p>When someone gets serious about cheating, there are three methods that have been studied in research literature:</p>

<h4 class="hx-underline">Paying someone to do it</h4>

<p>Just like there are websites where you can have someone write an essay for you, there are places that will take a MOOC for you. There's no good way around this. Even a verified certificate is no guarantee that someone else didn't take the entire course.</p>

<h4 class="hx-underline">Multiple Accounts</h4>

<p>We've seen people <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1508/1508.05699.pdf" target="_blank">create multiple accounts</a>, one or more of which is a "throwaway" that they use to mine for answers, and the other of which gets the points. Somewhere between 1% and 2% of certificate earners do this. Folks who have earned a large number of certificates are more likely to have done it, but the number doesn't go up above about 25%. People are often dumb about the account names: for instance, someone might use Colin_Fredericks as their main account, and Colin_Fredericks1 as their throwaway.<p>

<p>This approach is harder now that <a href="/jump_to_id/76b34b82b01544fdb1c521b90e33c3b4" target="_blank">feature-based enrollment</a> is a thing. <strong>Most problems are behind a paywall by default</strong>, and not many people are willing to pay twice as much to get the answers.</p>

<p>Even if FBE isn't in place for you, though, multiple-account cheating can be slowed down a lot if you do some <strong>assignment randomization</strong>. Check out the methods on the next page.</p>

<h4 class="hx-underline">Scripted Solvers</h4>

<p>This is fairly rare, but we do know that some people have scripts that go through a course and auto-answer everything in a matter of minutes. Again, <strong>randomized problems</strong> make this approach more difficult.</p>
