<h3 class="hx-underline">Why Alternative Navigation?</h3>

<p>For the vast majority of courses, a linear order of content works just fine. However, when you start to design courses with flexible learning pathways or different starting points for varying audience needs, the linear model can quickly feel limiting. In addition, the more innovative your course design, the more it will flout typical edX conventions, which means you need to work even harder to make sure people don't get lost in a mass of crazy 'unstructured' content!</p>

<p>Alternative navigation methods are an absolute must if you want users to recognise a different content structure. Without it, all your hard work at the design stage will be completely invisible to the user. This could be anything from slightly irksome to very problematic, let's say if the alternative pathways were part of an A-B research initiative to test effectiveness of design on learning. Bye bye research paper! ;)</p>

<p>The complexity required will be largely driven on your design. A few cross-references within pages may only need jump links; a 'choose your own adventure' design might need dragons and secret doorways on every page. Identifying just how much work you want to put into this aspect of your course will be important to consider BEFORE you agree on an adaptive adventure movie structure.</p>

<p>In the video below, HarvardX project lead Drew Lichtenstein talks about the pros and cons of alternative navigation schemes, and argues for thinking of it as "supplemental navigation."</p>
