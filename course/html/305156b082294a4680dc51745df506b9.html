<p>Typically when you write a problem in edX, grading is handled for you. This is for those times when it isn't, or when you wish you had some more control over it.</p>

<p>This section is primarily for people who write or use Custom-Graded problems and Javascript Input problems. EdX allows its users to create grading code for these kinds of problems in Python. (Really you can do it in any problem; you just <em>have</em> to do it in the custom ones.) Normally that code is kept inside each problem, but this shows you a way to centralize it so that you can fix problems in one place instead of having to fix them in multiple places.</p>

<p>
  <strong>The goal:</strong> Keep your custom grading code in one place instead of in every individual problem.<br/>
  <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> If you want to make your own, you need to know more than a bit of python - but if you just want to use someone else's, that reduces the skill barrier substantially. <br />
  <strong>Project length:</strong> Set aside a few hours to put it together and test it the first time, plus whatever time you need to actually write the grading code.
