<p>Creating cohorts can provide&nbsp;interesting ways to present different content to different user groups and improve user experience. However, they shouldn&rsquo;t be over-applied - thinking about why you need cohorts on your course and what you hope to achieve with them is the most important first step. This is often referred to as a &lsquo;Cohort Strategy&rsquo;, and without one you might end up with an overly complex course structure that&rsquo;s difficult to maintain or work out who can see what!</p>
