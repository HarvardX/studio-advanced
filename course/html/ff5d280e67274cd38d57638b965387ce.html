<h3 class="hx-underline">Examples of Alternative Navigation</h3>

<p>Some edX courses have already implemented forms of alternative or augmented navigation. Here are a few that you might want to peruse while considering your own approach.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first run of <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-world-harvardx-chem160x" target="_blank">The Quantum World</a>, from HarvardX, has a page known as "The Tunneler" (it's a quantum physics joke). It has a separate list of course pages, filterable by topic or content. The code that created this can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/Colin-Fredericks/hx-xml/tree/master/outline_maker" target="_blank">HX-XML repository</a>. The nice part is that you don't have to enter all the links by hand; the down side is that you need to basically have the course complete before you create this or you'll have to touch it up later.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/predictionx-john-snow-cholera-epidemic-harvardx-soc1-jsx" target="_blank">PredictionX: John Snow and the Cholera Epidemic of 1854</a>, also from HarvardX, uses a version of our <a href="/jump_to_id/9a8299914e364827bef20023b7bf2583" target="_blank">image carousel</a> to let learners jump between the most important pages in the course.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/fantastic-places-unhuman-humans-exploring-humanity-through-literature" target="_blank">Fantastic Places, Unhuman Humans: Exploring Humanity Through Literature</a>, from Brown University, has a "course map" that's literally a map - which fits their topic quite well.</li>
</ul>
