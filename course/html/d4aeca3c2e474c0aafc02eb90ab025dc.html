<h3 class="hx-underline">Why do I need to do anything?</h3>

<p>You may be wondering, "Why do I need to react to this? It's just another rule edX has; I can build my course without considering it."</p>

<p>Our philosophy is that every platform rule is a design constraint. You simply <em>can't build a great course in a platform-agnostic way</em>, any more than you can tell a pun that works in every language. Not that we're saying puns are our favorite thing (<em style="font-size: small">which they are</em>), but having a joke competition named Punderdome only works if the name of the movie in your language is Beyond Thunderdome and not simply Mad Max III.</p>

<p>The limitations imposed by Feature-Based Enrollment (FBE) reduce your ability to do whatever you want with your course. In exchange, you get a (probable) increase in verified certificates. FBE forces a choice: do you want to maintain access for the largest number of learners, or do you want to encourage a larger percentage of people to upgrade? On the next page we'll talk about that tradeoff and some options for leaning to one side or the other. However, we also want you to know that <em>simply doing nothing is also making a choice,</em> and in this case that choice comes down on the side of pushing verified enrollment.</p>

<p>On to the practical stuff.</p>
