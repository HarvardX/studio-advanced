<h3 class="hx-underline">Setup</h3>

<p>Before you run batch-processing scripts, you'll want to take the following steps:</p>

<h4 class="hx-underline">1. Ensure you're running Python3</h4>

<p>Our scripts were written for version 3+ of Python. Version 3.7.x is the current state of the art, but version 3.5 or later should work just as well. Python has a <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download" target="_blank">Beginner's Guide</a> that will walk you through the process, or you can <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">download the current version</a> if you're comfortable doing so.</p>

<div class="hx-redbox">
  <p><span class="fa fa-warning" style="color:darkred;"><span class="sr">Warning:</span></span> If the installer gives you the option to replace your current version of Python, <em><strong>do not replace your existing version of Python.</strong></em> Doing so can make your computer unusable. Install the new one but <em>keep the old one</em>.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="hx-underline">2. Install packages</h4>

<p>Some of our scripts rely on external packages:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/" target="_blank">Beautiful Soup version 4</a>, an improved html parser. You can <a href="https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/" target="_blank">install it via pip</a>, or find it in the <code class="lang-markup">bs4</code> folder from the <a href="https://github.com/Colin-Fredericks/hx-xml" target="_blank">HX-XML repository</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://lxml.de/" target="_blank">lxml</a>, an XML parser. You can <a href="https://pypi.org/project/lxml/" target="_blank">install this via pip</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="hx-underline">3. Get the scripts</h4>

<p>The easiest way to do this is to clone the <a href="https://github.com/Colin-Fredericks/hx-xml" target="_blank">HX-XML repository</a>. If you don't yet use GitHub, you can <a href="https://github.com/join" target="_blank">register for free</a> and <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">use the desktop app</a>, but you can also download the whole repository as a zip file or obtain the scripts one-by-one by downloading them from the repository. You don't need to register for that.</p>
