<h3 class="hx-underline">What is a 'content library'?</h3>
<p>In edX, a content library is essentially a question bank. It is a method of displaying a small selection of a larger set of questions, by creating a bank of questions in your library area (above the course-level) and making reference to the number of questions you would like to display within the course from that set.</p>

<h4 class="hx-underline">When would this be useful?</h4>

<p>Well, most people tend to use this method as a way of improving assessment validity. You can create a bank of 20 questions but only display 10, meaning if a learner were to attempt a test multiple times, e.g. an end of module quiz, they wouldn’t necessarily see the same questions each time.</p>

<p>However, it is important to note, this is all the tool does!</p>

<p>Usefully, the tool is very restricted. This means it is easy to decide at the beginning whether it is worth the time required to set up a content library. If you need more functionality than just basic randomisation with no dependencies, it is likely a different method would be better suited.</p>

<p>Praising restrictiveness might seem like a strange thing to say but trust us, the content library tool has some pretty time consuming quirks to consider before going down this route.</p>

<p>The main limitations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common/basic question types only - it is not possible to randomise advanced questions via this method. </li>
<li>Unable to reuse and remember - these are not intelligent question banks. If you wish to use the same library as revision and in a final exam, the system does not remember what has been shown previously to a learner. </li>
<li>Mixed sets need a new library instance - it is not possible to make three separate libraries then randomise a selection across the three combined. You will need to set up a new library including all the required questions combined.</li>
<li>Fixing mistakes can be time consuming - you can not edit in the course, it must be within the library directly, even though you can see all the questions in course edit view. Once edits have been made, you must also update the library reference in the course to ensure the most up-to-date version of components are being displayed.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, there are benefits to using content libraries:</p>
<ul>
  <li>edX supported feature - you don’t need to worry about keeping your code up-to-date as the platform does that for you.</li>
<li>Simple to use - whilst it can take a while to set up if you have a lot of questions, it is straightforward if you follow the logical sequence.</li>
  <li>Import and export of libraries is supported, so you can back them up and share them across projects.</li>
  <li>Ability to display some fixed questions and some randomised within the same assessment. N.B. Advanced problems would be fixed in all cases.</li>
</ul>
