<p>Some of Drew's key points about the pros and cons of building alternative navigation include:</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It creates a custom look to your course</li>
<li>Lets learners see pathways</li>
<li>You can expose the entire course layout on a page, not just on the home page</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Custom javascript could break</li>
<li>edX learners are used to edX so any alternative navigation needs to not confuse them</li>
</ul>
