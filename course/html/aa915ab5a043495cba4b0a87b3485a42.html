<p>EdX is really good at creating a straight-line experience for learners. Start at the beginning, move from page to page until the end. What if you don't want that?</p>

<p>Enter the beautiful, alluring, potentially disasterous world of alternative navigation schemes! A world where you can show your learners just what your course looks like, how things are connected, what they can learn from where, help them jump through the material with the greatest of ease - if you're very, very careful about it. Here we'll help you think through your design with the help of some good (and bad) examples.</p>

<div class="hx-bluebox">
  <h4><span class="fa fa-warning"></span> Just the design</h4>
  <p>Note that there's a different part of the course for <a href="/jump_to_id/7342bb4a152444f88f6be6aae64966cd" target="_blank"><em>implementing</em> an alternative navigation scheme</a> that you've already designed. This section is <em>just</em> about the design part. </p>
</div>
<div class="hx-redbox">
  <h4><span class="fa fa-question-circle"></span> Design takes too long, can't I just start building?</h4>
  <p>There is a word for implementing a complex thing that you haven't designed, and that word is "failing."</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> It will help a lot if you or someone involved in the project have some graphic design skills. Other than that, all you really need is HTML. <br/>
  <strong>Project length:</strong> Plan to spend a day on the design.<br/>
  <strong>Ingredients:</strong> </p>
  <ul class="hx-tightlist">
    <li>You need to know the general layout of your course. It doesn't need to be fully set in stone yet, but if you make big changes you might need to change the navigation.</li>
    <li>You will need to know how the course content is interconnected, or work with someone who does.</li>
    <li>For the mockup stage, we recommend some drawing materials, like some colored pencils and paper, a whiteboard, or PowerPoint.</li>
  </ul>
