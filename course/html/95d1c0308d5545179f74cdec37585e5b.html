<h3 class="hx-underline">Thank you!</h3>

<p>Joking videos aside, our most heartfelt and genuine thanks go out to...</p>

<ul>
  <li>HarvardX for funding the creation of this course</li>
  <li>Our video guests: Dustin Tingly, Shilpa Idnani, Drew Lichtenstein, and Andrew Ang.</li>
  <li>Our consultants, Shelly Upton, Mary Ellen Wiltrout, and Dan Davis</li>
  <li>The many HarvardX staff who reviewed this course and suggested ways to make it better</li>
  <li>EdX and the Open edX community for all their work in creating this platform</li>
  <li>And, of course, you for coming here to participate. We hope you got a lot out of this course, and that you'll keep coming back to it when you need more!</li>
</ul>

<p>We're basically done. There are some appendices with bits and bobs that we couldn't fit in anywhere else. Like we said - come back any time.</p>
