<p>Open Response Assessments (ORA) get a lot of bad press. Users and instructors alike see them as hard work, and something that typically comes at the end of the course - the final slog towards the certificate goal. This attitude means lots miss out on the opportunity to engage with quite possibly the greatest pieces of scalable community engagement!</p>

<p>ORAs provide an ability to connect with peers. It might seem scary at the start to put a piece of work in front of strangers for review, but most users are really constructive with feedback and thrive in the environment when given the chance. So why are they always left to the end?  &macr;\_(ãƒ„)_/&macr;</p>

<p>There is literally no reason why you should only see them once in a course with no opportunity to learn the method. Plus, there is no reason to make them so complicated, especially if a training exercise.</p>

<ul>
<li>Did you know you can upload images and files to ORAs?</li>
<li>Did you know you can remove all rubric settings if you wanted to encourage open response, or only use one criterion for assessment to make engagement super quick?</li>
<li>Did you know you you can include instructor submissions as examples?</li>
<li>Did you know you can add a list of top responses to view after the learner submits their work?</li>
<li>Did you know you could remove the peer engagement step?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>Whilst you wouldn't want to necessarily implement all of these points at once, it's important to realise the ORA can actually do a lot. You could set it up as a mechanism for sharing images, which feed into a gallery view. Or you could use it as a closed peer Q&amp;A - user 1 asks a question that is then answered (instead of feedback reviewed) by users 2 and 3. Once you know the parameters you're working with, it's a lot easier to make something interesting out of it!</p>
