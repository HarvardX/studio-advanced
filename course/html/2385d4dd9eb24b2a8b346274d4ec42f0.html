<p>Some video-hosting platforms allow you to pop up little links within your video, for extra info or advertising or what-have-you. Now you can do that too! We'll show you how.</p>

<p>This project is in the "Operating Procedures" section because to really use it well, you want to use it <em>throughout</em> your course and not just once. That means adding an extra step to your video process, around the same time that you'd be inserting images or stock footage. You can try to do it all afterward, but it's going to feel like a much bigger lift then. Make it a regular part of your practice and it'll be much easier on you.</p>
