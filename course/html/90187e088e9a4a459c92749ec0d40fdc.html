<h4 class="hx-underline">Random problem ordering</h4>

<p>We've mentioned elsewhere how <a href="/jump_to_id/3f686540e80b450db4d5a57652fa5dea" target="_blank">Content Experiments</a> are great for research, but you can also use them just to provide problems in a random manner! Create some extra assignments, create your Content Experiment groups, and move things around so that different learners see slightly different questions.</p>

<p>You can combine this with the randomization above, but this approach really shines when you have problems that are difficult to randomize. Things like <a href="/jump_to_id/5233c0d92bd743d8b8a48b4e5b158cad" target="_blank">Open Response Assessments</a>, drag-and-drop questions, questions you've brought in via LTI, all those complex things that are cool and unique, you can still randomize those! You just need to create a few spares.</p>

<p>Another option is a <a href="/jump_to_id/36e997744b06459fab8f26fcfe6b8579" target="_blank">content library</a>, which we've discussed in detail elsewhere in the course. We just wanted to give you a little reminder here: you can pull just a handful of problems from a larger library, so that most people will be seeing different sets of problems. Follow that link to get more info.</p>
