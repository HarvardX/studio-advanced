<h3 class="hx-underline">How it works</h3>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ve worked out what you want to do with cohorts and you&rsquo;ve considered the platform variables that can be changed, it&rsquo;s time to go on platform.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The following video shows a really simple example of setting up cohort for a common usage - creating smaller discussion groups - and covers the basic workflow for setting up automatic allocation cohorts. The &lsquo;Cohort Strategy&rsquo; for the demo is as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<div class="hx-bluebox">
  <h4><span class="fa fa-list"></span> Demo course strategy</h4>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Rationale: to improve user engagement with discussion boards by making them less overwhelming in size</li>
<li>3 cohorts required: Cohort A, Cohort B &amp; Cohort C&nbsp;</li>
<li>Automatic allocation - it doesn&rsquo;t matter who is in each group, size is most important</li>
<li>No specific content required - will use a survey at the end to assess user perceptions</li>
</ul>
</ul>
