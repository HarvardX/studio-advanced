<h3 class="hx-underline">The Sample Video</h3>

<p>Did you know we rearranged this course partway through creating it? This sort of thing happens fairly commonly, even with very experienced course designers. We had originally intended there to be three different project lengths: hour-long, day-long, and week-long. Eventually we threw out "day-long", folding its projects into other areas. We even scripted a quick intro for the day-long section, and decided to film it in case we ever wanted to rebuild that section.</p>

<p>Why waste it, right? It's our sample video below.</p>

<p>Play the video through to see the links. They should show up at 15 seconds, 21 seconds, and 28 seconds. Then scroll down for a list of the links - useful for accessibility, and in case the javascript fails.</p>
