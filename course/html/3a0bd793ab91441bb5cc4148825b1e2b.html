<h3 class="hx-underline">Encouraging Verification</h3>

<p>What can you do if you want to <em>encourage your learners to purchase a verified certificate?</em> This is aside from discussions of price points, willingness to pay, etc. We nerds writing this course don't know anything about that anyway.</p>

<h4 class="hx-underline">&#128176; Give Free Samples</h4>

<p>Don't wall off <em>everything</em>. That's like putting together a portfolio and leaving out your best work. No one's going to give you money based on that. You need to give people a taste of what the course is going to be like.</p>

<p>We recommend having at least a quarter of your assessments visible to all learners. Make these <em>real</em> assessments, not just the easy stuff. That way your learners will know what they're signing up for when they go to buy a verified certificate.</p>

<h4 class="hx-underline">&#128552; Build Cliffhangers</h4>

<p>Your learners will realize that there are some assessments they don't see, just from the presence of the <a href="/static/verified_access_banner_full.png" target="_blank">lock icon</a>. However, they might not see them as very important. If you want to entice people to pay for a verified certificate, you need to make them a crucial, integral part of the learning experience.</p>

<p>One way to do that is to create intentional, obvious lead-ins to the assignments. Give your learners the beginning of a story in a place that everyone can see, and the <em>resolution</em> to that story in a gated assignment. Show the materials for an intriguing assignment in HTML that everyone can access, but keep the assignment itself behind the paywall. Make a game out of it, then make them want to win the game.</p>
