  <h4><span class="fa fa-question-circle"></span> Problems as Surveys?</h4>
  <p>It is possible to use assessment quiz tools for surveys BUT these will have credit associated, expect a right/wrong answer, and give a grade at the end. Whilst it would provide you with a fuller set of question types than a poll, the user experience would not be great. You can turn some of these options off using answer visibility, setting every answer as correct, etc., but on the whole you're better off using the right tool for the right job.</p>
