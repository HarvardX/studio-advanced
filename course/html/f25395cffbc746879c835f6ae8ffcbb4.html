<p>We’ve all been there - one great idea for interacting with content, to help visualise a difficult concept, snowballs into a whole course design suddenly overrun by a complex web of interdependent activities and adaptive release components. But whilst the ideas are obviously exciting to design and build, will they really have the revolutionary impact on student learning that warrants making it your life’s work? The reality: probably not.</p>
<p>
So how can you tone some of these ideas back without losing enthusiasm in the course team? Most of the conversations don’t have to change (unless the ‘adaptive’ idea pops up!) it’s just about trying to seek simple but creative solutions first with native functionality, before moving on to any bespoke build. This approach will certainly help to get your weekends back!
