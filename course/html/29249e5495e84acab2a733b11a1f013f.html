<h3 class="hx-underline">Don't Repeat Yourself</h3>

<p>If you're a programmer, you've probably heard the mantra "Don't Repeat Yourself", or DRY. (In fact, you've probably heard it so many times that it's become somewhat ironic...) The idea is that writing code in one place and <em>referencing</em> it or <em>calling</em> it in other places is not only faster in terms of raw keystrokes, but better for the structure of your programs.</p>

<p>The edX platform doesn't <em>completely</em> believe in the DRY principle, but this is one place where it's been implemented to a T.</p>

<p>Keeping your code in a grading library means that...</p>

<ul>
  <li>As mentioned before, you don't need to fix it in a dozen places if you have a dozen of the same problem type. You can just fix the library.</li>
  <li>It's just plain easier to keep track of. You don't need to download the course tarbal and search through it painstakingly for every custom problem, you can just reupload a single file.</li>
  <li>You can implement more complex code without creating a bloated 200-line-long XML file.</li>
  <li>In fact, your code can get big enough to handle exceptions, corner cases, and even multiple options without breaking. </li>
  <li>As you get better at programming, you can have fewer embarassments out in the wild. Not that your author would know anything about that, no.</li>
</ul>
