<p>With all of this, the most important aspect is practice. The more you experiment and troubleshoot, the easier and more intuitive it will become.</p>
<h5>Suggested next steps</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Create a test area in an edX course you have access to.</li>
  <li>Using our <a href="/static/example.css" target="_blank">example.css</a> as a starting file, upload to the course and play around with some of the HTML.</li>
  <li>Once feeling more confident, manipulate some of the variables, such as border widths, colours and padding. Upload again. What happens to the test page? Was it as you expected?</li>
  <li>Take a look at the css in the <a href="https://github.com/Colin-Fredericks/hx-js" target="_blank">HX-JS Github repository</a>.</li>
  <li>Feeling adventurous? Have a look online for other bits of simple HTML or develop your own .css file.</li>
