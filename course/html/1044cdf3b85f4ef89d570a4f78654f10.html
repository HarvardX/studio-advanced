<p></p>
<p>Do you have any top tips about setting up surveys that you'd like to share with the community? Or maybe a question about setting up a new survey? If so, we'd love to see a post form you on the discussion board below.</p>
<p>As a starting point, why not share comments, experiences or tips on some of the topics below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up research questions</li>
<li>Ethics approval</li>
<li>Proofreading</li>
<li>Build &amp; proof again</li>
<li>Research trials</li>
<li>Launch</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember: If you are planning to use surveys for academic research purpose, rather than for course improvement purpose, you will likely require ethics approval as per your standard institution process.</p>
