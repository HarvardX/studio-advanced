<h3 class="hx-underline">Final Considerations</h3>

<p>Now that you've seen a few specific cases - all of them intentionally flawed in some way - let's go over some general guidelines.</p>

<ol style="font-weight:bold;">
  <li><strong>Build only what you need.</strong> <span style="font-weight:normal;">Many courses do not need alternative navigation. If your learners will be better served by moving through the course in order, let them do that and spend your effort elsewhere.</span></li>
  <li><strong>Test, test, test.</strong> <span style="font-weight:normal;">Make sure that a lot of people see your navigation before it gets into the world. Get feedback from all of them.</span></li>
  <li><strong>Have a goal.</strong> <span style="font-weight:normal;">Your navigation should help your learners do something <em>specific</em>. Do you want them to be able to skip past things they already know? Should they get a better understanding of the interconnection between topics? Will your navigation set the context for what your learners see? Your navigation will be most effecive if you pick a single purpose and build toward it.</span></li>
  <li><strong>Have a backup plan.</strong> <span style="font-weight:normal;">Your navigation might break some day - or you might simply make a typo that leaves a page inaccessible! If you can bear to leave edX's existing navigation in place, do so. If you can do without fancy javascript libraries, do without.</span></li>
  <li><strong>Follow design principles.</strong> <span style="font-weight:normal;">As the saying goes, "The opposite of <em>good</em> design is not <em>no</em> design, it's <em>bad</em> design."</span></li>
