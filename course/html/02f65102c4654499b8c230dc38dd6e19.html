<p>Behold the grail. <span class="fa fa-trophy"></span></p>

<p>Adaptive learning is what we've all been promised since the first person involved in online education wrote a grant application. Unfortunately, it turns out to be really difficult. So we're not going to give you "the solution" here, because A:&nbsp;there's no one solution, and B:&nbsp;there's no magic wand that will "adaptivize" your course. Instead, we'll show a few options, talk about the work you'll need to do regardless of what option you choose, and give you a realistic view of the field.</p>

<p><strong>The goal:</strong> Learn about options for adaptivity in edX.<br/>
  <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> To learn about it: you only need to know what an LTI tool is. To actually implement it: everything. You need HTML, CSS, Javscript, design skills, Python or another server-side language, experience running a server, and a good injection of extra cash.<br/>
  <strong>Project length:</strong> Be ready to spend a year.<br/>
  <strong>Ingredients:</strong>

  <ul class="hx-tightlist">
    <li>Lots of variants on (or extensions of) your course materials.</li>
    <li>Other than that, it depends on what you want to do. Sit tight and we'll give you some links.</li>
  </ul>
