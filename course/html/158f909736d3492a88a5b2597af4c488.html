<p>EdX offers a wide range of assessments. Five of them (Multiple-choice, Checkbox, Dropdown, Numerical, and Text) are "Common" problem types, and can be written in a simple markdown format. These will cover a wide variety of needs, and will be the bread and butter of assessment in most courses. However, sometimes you want to ask questions that don't easily map to one of these problems. That's when you turn to Advanced Problem Types.</p> 

<p>This section presents a few types of Advanced Problem, so that you can better understand what's available and select what to use throughout your course.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> To learn what's available, nothing. To implement them, you need familiarity with HTML, and sometimes with Python and Javascript. You will also need to be a content expert in this course, or work with someone who is. Someone could <em>implement</em> advanced questions without needing to know the course material well, but you can't <em>select</em> which ones to implement unless you understand the course subject.<br/>
  <strong>Project length:</strong> 60 minutes to learn, 60 minutes to decide and create a few mockups, 30+ minutes to build each advanced problem.<br/>
  <strong>Ingredients:</strong> Many advanced problems are already supported within edX. However:</p>
  <ul class="hx-tightlist">
    <li>Some advanced tools and problems will need to be activated via <a href="/jump_to_id/510e3a15f1ab409a8871c71cf2bc9408" target="_blank">Advanced Settings</a>.</li>
    <li>For some Javascript Problems, you will want to obtain code from Stanford's <a href="https://github.com/Stanford-Online/js-input-samples/" target="_blank">JSInput Repository</a>. You will often need to edit JSON or XML files to use these.</li>
