<h3 class="hx-underline">Custom Display Settings</h3>

<p>Because sometimes you typo your course number.</p>

<h4><button class="hx-togglebutton10">
Cosmetic Course Display Price
</button></h4>
<div class="hx-toggletarget10" style="display:none;">
  <p><strong>Default:</strong> 0</p>
  <p><strong>Other settings:</strong> A number without a dollar/currency sign</p>
  <p><i>The cost displayed to students for enrolling in the course. If a paid course registration price is set by an administrator in the database, that price will be displayed instead of this one.</i></p>
  <p>Probably better left to said administrator, unless your org has a policy of letting everyone set their own price. We can't advise you on how much to charge for your course, but please do remember that a large number of edX learners are from outside the industrialized world.</p>

<h4 id="displayname"><button class="hx-togglebutton15">
Course Display Name <span class="fa-stack"><span class="fa fa-star fa-stack-1x"></span><span class="fa fa-star-o fa-stack-1x"><span class="sr">star</span></span></span>
</button></h4>
<div class="hx-toggletarget15" style="display:none;">
  <p><strong>Default:</strong> Whatever you set it as when creating your course</p>
  <p><strong>Other settings:</strong> any text</p>
  <p><i>Enter the name of the course as it should appear in the edX.org course list.</i></p>
  <p>Why do we have a star on this one? Because we want you to remember that <em>it's ok to change your course name</em>. As long as no one says the course name in a video, you can listen to your marketing research and switch up the name to whatever you want.</p>
  <p>Also: if you start your course by importing a pre-made template like we do, you'll end up with a course name like "HarvardX Blank Template Course". Or maybe you just made a typo. Here's the setting to fix that.</p>
</div>

<h4><button class="hx-togglebutton21">
Course Number Display String
</button></h4>
<div class="hx-toggletarget21" style="display:none;">
  <p><strong>Default:</strong> ""</p>
  <p><strong>Other settings:</strong> any text</p>
  <p><i>Enter the course number that you want to appear in the course. This setting overrides the course number that you entered when you created the course. To use the course number that you entered when you created the course, enter null.</i></p>
  <p>If you start your course by importing a pre-made template like we do, you'll end up with all your learners seeing the same course number for every single course. Or maybe you just made a typo. Here's the setting to fix that.</p>
</div>

<h4><button class="hx-togglebutton22">
Course Organization Display String
</button></h4>
<div class="hx-toggletarget22" style="display:none;">
  <p><strong>Default:</strong> null</p>
  <p><strong>Other settings:</strong> any text</p>
  <p><i>Enter the course organization that you want to appear in the course. This setting overrides the organization that you entered when you created the course. To use the organization that you entered when you created the course, enter null.</i></p>
  <p>Maybe you made a typo and just told the world that your course is from Hvarard, or maybe Oxdord. Oops. Here's the setting to fix that.</p>
