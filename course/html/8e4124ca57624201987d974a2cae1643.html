<h3 class="hx-underline">Maintaining Access</h3>

<p>What can you do if you want to <em>maintain the greatest amount of access</em> for the largest percentage of your learners? For instance, your course may be sponsored by a grant with a mandate to make the course material public to the world. How can you do that with FBE?</p>

  <h4>Oops All Beta Testers?</h4>
  <p>No, it is not reasonable to make everyone in your course a beta tester. We're not trying to recommend end-runs around edX's money-making strategies here; we're trying to work within the system. Use beta tester access for course contributors, teachers using the course in their classroom, and, of course, for actual beta testers - but don't just add everyone to this category.</p>

<h4 class="hx-underline"><span class="fa fa-check" style="color:green;"></span> <span class="fa fa-times" style="color:crimson;"></span> Access to Assignments</h4>

<p>Set the weight of every problem to 0! That was easy!</p>

<p>What? Oh. Oh, no one can pass the course now. I suppose that's not always a "realistic" or "feasible" option unless you like "euphemisms" and "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scare_quotes" target="_blank">scare quotes</a>."</p>

<p>Still, you may be able to set the weights of a <em>lot</em> of assessments to zero, which will let them appear to all learners. The question is what to do with the rest of the assessment. You could have a single problem behind the paywall that asks "Would you like your certificate?" and make it worth 100% of the learners' grade, but that doesn't go very far toward maintaining academic integrity.</p>

<p>What we recommend is setting most of your assessments to a weight of 0 points - real assessments, not throw-away problems! - and then having a <strong>small selection of difficult graded problems that are near-duplicates</strong> of some tough 0-point problems you've already asked. That way you're not hiding anything substantive from the audit learners. Verified learners who have already done the real work of your course will easily pass and get their certificate. Verified learners who <em>haven't</em> done the work yet will still need to put in effort - they don't get the certificate just because they paid money.</p>

<p>If you're willing to pass up the money to be made in IDV revenue (and lose your chance at being a thousandaire??), there are also some monetary approaches that may work. Consider setting the verified price of your course as close to $0 as possible and/or providing universal financial aid. Even a $10 price tag can be a burden for some learners. You'll need to make this clear in multiple places throughout the course - we recommend having a Syllabus Quiz question about it.</p>

<h4 class="hx-underline">&#128218; Access to Course Materials</h4>

<p>The immediate thing that comes to most minds is setting the length of the course to something very long - for instance, 52 weeks. Unfortunately, there are two problems with this approach. First, it makes some learners think that the course is actually, genuinely, an entire year long when it's really only six weeks. Enrollment may go down as a result. Second, edX has a max duration of 18 weeks hard-coded into the platform. So that idea's shot.</p>

<p>An "immediate-rerun" strategy may help to some extent. That's where you open a rerun of the course on the same day when the previous run closes. It's better than nothing, but it can be frustrating to learners when they need to keep re-enrolling again and again - especially if they're a teacher who relies on the course for their own on-campus classes</p>

<p>You might consider building an external website to which learners gain access after they enroll. There you can duplicate your existing course text, and perhaps link to the videos as well. You probably won't be able to provide assessment there, but at least <em>some</em> of the course material will be available after the learners lose access to the course proper.</p>

<p>Finally, don't forget the monetary approach mentioned above. Once someone is ID-verified, they maintain their access to the course materials indefinitely. If you're not concerned with IDV income from this course, give it away.</p>
