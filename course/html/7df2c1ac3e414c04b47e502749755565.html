  <h3><span class="fa fa-question-circle"></span> Wait But Why?</h3>
  <p>This section tells you <em>how</em> to build alternative navigation for your course, but what if you're not sold on <em>why?</em> Why would someone want to go through all the trouble of avoiding edX's built-in navigation system?</p>
  <p>If you'd like to learn more about some of the rationales for alternative navigation, items to consider while planning, and the "pro tips" for keeping the process manageable, head over to our section on <a href="/jump_to_id/f882a67fd66e4660aec6c675f57052db" target="_blank">Designing Alternative Navigation</a>. It's definitely not the kind of thing you want to jump into without preparation and careful consideration.</p>
