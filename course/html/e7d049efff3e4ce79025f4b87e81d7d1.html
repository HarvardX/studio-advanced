<h3 class="hx-underline">Why bother changing your landing page?</h3>

<p>The landing page is the first thing people see when they log into the course. On a typical edx course, you are greeted with a course overview structure. This is just the standard accordion display of the course content. Every section, subsection and unit page title on show to get the learners ready to learn.</p>
  
<p>Sometimes, if you're lucky, you might see a plain-text message from the course team. </p>

<p>This is the first thing learners see on a course. You cannot reroute them to see something else - they will <em>always</em> be taken to this view. Let's face it, it's not the most exciting space visually. It doesn't typically reflect the amazing content you have hidden just one click away on the first page. It also doesn't explain your exciting but different course navigation.</p>
  
<p>But it doesn't have to be that way...</p> 

<h4 class="hx-underline">For a limited time only</h4>

<p>For the first 3 weeks of enrollment, a new learner can see a welcome post on the course. This is the space occupied by the plain-text message from the course team. But it can be soooooo much more than that!</p>

<p>If you’ve ever tried to search for ‘landing page’ in edX support pages, you will know there are no hits. That’s because this is a small hack of the ‘updates’ feature which allows you to create announcements and welcome messages to learners. Updates are html compatible but do not offer a rich editor within the creator interface (which is why most people don't realise you can do funky stuff with them!)</p>

<p>Armed with the knowledge this area is fully html and css compatible, your course update can be as long and as varied as your imagination (although, do keep the user experience and course purpose in mind when you create anything new!)</p>
