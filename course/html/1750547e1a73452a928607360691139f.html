<p>Whilst we made the case for incorporating CSS in the &lsquo;Creating a Style Sheet&rsquo; section, one piece of advice is abundantly clear: less is definitely best.</p>
<p>This section outlines when good intentions (for your code) turn bad for the user experience, highlighting that just because you can change it, doesn&rsquo;t mean you should.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Typically when you approach the idea of CSS, you have reached a point in your course development where the tools on offer in the &lsquo;native&rsquo; editor (i.e. the page editor built into the platform) do not fulfil your design aspirations for the content and you know you will want to use these elements multiple times throughout the course. CSS allows you to override the native style and replace it with a new reference style.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is important to note the obvious: edX like all other platforms already has its own look and feel. Implementing too much additional formatting can sometimes feel like you are fighting to make a point, rather than improving the user experience through well chosen additional formatting when a design gap is identified. With CSS, it is very easy to go crazy and change everything - but you absolutely shouldn&rsquo;t!&nbsp;</p>
