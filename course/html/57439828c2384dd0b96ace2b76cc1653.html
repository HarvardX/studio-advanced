<h3 class="hx-underline">A Sample Content Experiment</h3>

<p>Below you'll see a very simple content experiment. You will be in one of three groups: A, B, or C.</p> 

<ul>
  <li>Group A will see a multiple-choice problem.</li>
  <li>Group B will see a check-all-that-apply problem.</li>
  <li>Group C will see a dropdown problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>All three problems have the exact same choices, with the same wording and the same answer. Only the format of the problem differs.</p>


<div class="hx-orangebox">
  <h4>No choice in this adventure</h4>
  <p>There's no way for your learners to switch between content groups, so this is not a way to implement a choose-your-own adventure. They get what they get.</p>
