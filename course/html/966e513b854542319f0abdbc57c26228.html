<p>Simplicity is key. Only add new CSS formatting where a specific need has been identified.</p>
<p>Think back to your experience of swapping the different styles on the previous page. How did it make you feel? Probably like you had done something wrong, but you hadn&rsquo;t - you just encountered a page with far too much CSS/HTML formatting which resulted in a poor user experience.</p>

<p>Remember, less is best.</p>
