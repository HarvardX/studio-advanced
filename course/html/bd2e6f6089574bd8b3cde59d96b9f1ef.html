<h3 class="hx-underline">Linking It up: the Easy Version</h3>

<p>There are two potential pieces of HTML that you could be using in your navigation schemes. The one you would <em>like</em> to use looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;a href=&quot;/jump_to_id/d762c2a2f8b94b40836ebc75d1c5f67e&quot;&gt;Linked Thing&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>

<p>...where "Linked Thing" is going to be text, or an image, or part of an image map. This is called a "jump to ID" link. The <a href="https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-partner-course-staff/en/latest/course_components/create_html_component.html?highlight=jump_to_id#add-a-link-to-a-course-unit" target="_blank">edX documentation on links</a> has all the info about them, and you've probably seen the description in Studio under "Unit Location" more than once. These links are great in that they work for later runs of the same course. Good stuff, A++, would use again, try this first.</p>
