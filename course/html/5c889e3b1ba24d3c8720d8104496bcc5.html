<h4 class="hx-underline">Stuff you can do with Basic Qs</h4>

<p>Basic problem ‘levelling up’ includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adding hints and prompts</li>
  <li>Randomising answer order</li>
  <li>Showing only a random subset of questions</li>
  <li>Setting numerical tolerances</li>
  <li>Adding alterate correct answers</li>
</ul>

<p>Basic questions, whether in a formative or summative assessment context, are an invaluable way of creating a sense of the ‘tutor at scale’. Learners know you’re not going to be there all the time online, but setting up aids, prompts, and improved experiences, helps to reinforce that someone that cares about their learner experience set up the course! What’s more, when you pop a little helpful nudge into a question or direct them back to previous content to help answer the question, it’s a bit like you’re tutoring them individually (but at scale!) This is where the digital really comes into its own.</p>
