  <h4><span class="fa fa-question-circle"><span class="sr">Question:</span></span> How do you know what worked?</h4>
  <p><strong>Short version:</strong> Educational research is an entire field of study and we're not writing you a one-pager on it.</p>
  <p><strong>Long version:</strong> Regardless of what you're testing, you will need to decide what your succeses measures are before you implement. A few questions to consider:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Are you measuring learner performance on tests? Is "performance" just their grade? Does it include speed of performance? Number of attempts? Persistence/retention? Long-term recall?</li>
    <li>Are you measuring survey responses?</li>
    <li>Are your tests and surveys validated to ensure that they measure what you think they measure?</li>
    <li>Do you have a baseline measurement for your learners' content knowledge or affective state from earlier in the course?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If item validity and baseline measurements are unfamiliar to you, contact your local educational researcher and ask for help. <strong>"We'll figure it out later" is not how good research gets done.</strong> Planning is key. Testing content without a plan for evaluating its success is just a waste of time.</p>
