<h4 class="hx-underline">Getting your new library into a course</h4>
<p>So your content library is fully populated with required questions and ready to be included within your course. Brilliant! Below is a whistle-stop guide to getting your randomised questions displayed in-course:
<p></p>

<p>Step 1: Enable "library_content" in Advanced settings of your course</p>
<p><a href="/static/CL_setup1.png" target="_blank"><img width="800" src="/static/CL_setup1.png" alt="Add library_content to the advanced module list." /></a></p>

<p>Step 2: Add a randomised content block as an advanced component on an assessment unit/page</p>
<p><a href="/static/CL_setup_2.png" target="_blank"><img width="800" src="/static/CL_setup_2.png" alt="Click on Advanced and select Randomised Content Block" /></a></p>

<p>Step 3: Select a library and state the number of questions required </p>

<p>There are two important bits of information in the component block settings: library to reference and number of questions to display. 'Count' refers to the number of items (most typically questions) you would like to display to learners. Under 'library' you can select the required content library for your section - it will list every library you have access to, so this is where the unique references come in handy!</p>
<p>Once this is saved, your randomised component will be enabled and learners will see a subset only of the full list of questions in the library. You can double check the questions in the library by pressing 'view' on the block.</p>
