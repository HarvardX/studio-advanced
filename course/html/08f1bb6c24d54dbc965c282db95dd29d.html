Once these questions are answered, you're ready to build your research on platform" class="hx-hangright" /></a></p>

<p>Great! Now - what do you do with it? Here are a few options, from the obvious to the obscure.</p>

<h3 class="hx-underline">Actually Testing Content ("A/B Testing")</h3>

<p>I mean, they're called "content tests" after all. The primary intent was to allow course designers to try out different materials that supposedly teach the same material and see which one is better. This feature is quite well-designed for such randomized trials.</p>

<p>You could test out...</p>

<ul>
  <li>Different problem types, like we did above</li>
  <li>Different wordings for the same problem</li>
  <li>Similar pieces of text, rewritten for different grade levels</li>
  <li>A variety of images, to see which figures are most helpful</li>
  <li>A video, some text, and an interactive, to see which teaches a concept better</li>
  <li>An optional piece of material vs. nothing at all</li>
  <li>All sorts of things!</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="hx-underline">Keeping Groups vs. Shuffling Groups</h3>

<p>You can reuse experimental conditions multiple times across a course by just selecting the same group configuration. Alternatively, you can create a second (or third, or...) group configuration that re-shuffles the learners into new experimental conditions. When would you use which approach?</p>

<p>Keeping the same groups can be useful when you want to build up additional signal in the often-noisy environment of online data collection. By repeating an experiment multiple times across a course, you make its effects more visible. You can also use this approach to reverse your groups partway through a course. Perhaps one group sees animated videos for the first half of the course and direct-to-camera videos for the second half, and the other group sees the opposite.</p>

<p>In general, reusing the same groups multiple times will be the tactic you want to take, but there are some exceptions. Reshuffling your experimental groups is most often used when you have two (or more) separate experiments running in your course, and you want to keep them independent from one another. You might also switch up groups within the same study in order to reduce the effects of familiarity. Perhaps you don't want to measure an effect that depends on how well someone <em>knows</em> a tool, you want to see <em>how easy the tool is to use in general.</em> Showing the tool intermittently and randomly will reduce familiarity effects and emphasize effects from the tool's UX design.</p>

<h3 class="hx-underline">Cheating Reduction</h3>

<p>When different learners see different problems, it's more difficult to cheat. We talk about this elsewhere in the course, so we won't spend much time on it here, but one of the most common cheating methods in MOOCs is to create two different accounts, one of which takes a dive to find the answers for the other. When the two accounts see different questions, it makes that tactic a lot less valuable.</p>

<h3 class="hx-underline">Forced Collaboration</h3>

<p>MOOCs are often designed to be completed by single individuals. However, they don't need to be that way. You can send learners to the discussion board with different information, and ask them to combine it. You can give students one of five different parts of a map, a password, or a treasure hunt, and make them put them together. You could be really mean (perhaps too mean?) and give each group the hints that will let them answer the other's assignment.</p>

<p>This won't be everyone's cup of tea. Taking this pedagogical strategy really commits you to an interactive course, and to monitoring the discussion boards. Expect some negative feedback from your learners. However, if you're really committed to a course where learners <em>must</em> work together, this is one way to achieve it.</p>
