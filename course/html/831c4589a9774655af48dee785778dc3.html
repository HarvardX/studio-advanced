  <h4>Community Teaching Assistants</h4>
  <p>Community TAs are a wonderful resource in edX. The documentation mentions them in half a dozen places, but never really collects the idea in one spot, so here it is: Community TAs are volunteers who help make your course run better. They're unpaid beta testers and forum moderators who are there for the love of the topic. They want to help others learn.</p>
  <p>Community TAs can see both gated and ungated content, retain access to the course after it ends, can edit discussion posts, and get a special identifier in the forums so that other people know their role.</p>

<p>EdX provides extensive advice for <a href="https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-partner-course-staff/en/latest/manage_discussions/index.html" target="_blank">Managing Discussions</a> in their official documentation. It can be a lot to read through. Let's boil it down to a few core principles.</p>

<h4 class="hx-underline"><span class="fa fa-smile-o"></span> Pick Good Moderators</h4>

<p>Forum moderators (often in the form of Community TAs) are the welcoming face of your course. They're the first people most learners will meet in the discussion board. Good moderators are friendly, helpful, enthusiastic, diligent, and knowledgeable, in that order. It's much more useful to have a friendly moderator who can point someone to outside resources than a cranky jerk who can answer all the questions themselves.</p>

<h4 class="hx-underline"><span class="fa fa-heart"></span> Love Your Staff</h4>

<p>Show your staff the love. E-mail them as a group once a week. (Use BCC.) Tell them you appreciate their work. If one of them wants you to write them a recommendation, do it. Community TAs volunteer because they want to help others learn, but that doesn't mean they won't appreciate your kind words as well.</p>

<h4 class="hx-underline"><span class="fa fa-microphone"></span> Talk Often, Act Rarely</h4>

<p>Someone should be in the discussion board every day. Ideally, you want that someone to be a Community TA (or several!) so that you're not trying to do all the work yourself. Regardless, someone should be responding to queries, posting links, giving hints, and generally making it feel like there's a presence in the course.</p>

<p>EdX learners are highly, almost suspiciously, well-behaved. You'll rarely have issues with spam, flame wars, excessive foul language, etc. If you do have trouble, start with a light touch and escalate when needed, remembering that your learners may not be notified when you reply to them.</p>

<h4 class="hx-underline"><span class="fa fa-camera-retro"></span> Track Moderation</h4>

<p>There's no way in the edX discussion board to tell when someone's post has been edited. Everyone should write <i>*edited by Soandso*</i> in the posts that they change, but it's also important to keep a long-term record of issues, so that repeat offenders are noticed early. We use a Google Spreadsheet for that, which you can see an example of here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14EO82Um9n0h8HUIoKWjWw3kfUXTbHcHiHxhdxHQxez8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Moderation Tracker</a>. Feel free to make yourself a copy and use it in your own course.</p>

<h4 class="hx-underline"><span class="fa fa-lock"></span> Close Your Archived Classes</h4>

<p>When your course becomes archived, you probably want to close the discussion boards. We recommend doing this by setting up a <a href="https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-partner-course-staff/en/latest/manage_discussions/running_discussions.html#specify-when-discussions-are-closed" target="_blank">Discussion Blackout</a> starting maybe a week or two after the course ends, and going until the year 3000. You can pin a post to the board letting everyone know that the discussions are closed.</p>

<p>Without the discussion blackout, learners will expect that the questions they ask in the forum will be answered. They may be upset when no one responds.</p>

<div class="hx-bluebox">
  <h4>This discussion is not what I hoped.</h4>
  <p>Sometime you get a course with a beautiful, vibrant forum, where people discuss the course material in great depth and with a philosophical bent. Other times the discussion board is a valuable Q&amp;A resource where people solve each others' problems.</p>
  <p>Sometimes the forums are just dead. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
  <p>You can try to entice people into the forums with links in your weekly e-mails. You can make them a welcoming, helpful place. At some point, though, you need to let them be what they are. Don't get attached to your idea of what the forums should be. React to them as they are, and both you and your learners will be happier for it.</p>
