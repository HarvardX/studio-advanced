  <h4><span class="fa fa-warning"></span> MOOCs vs. SPOCs</h4>
  <p>This advice is for large, public online courses with large enrollments. We're not going to get into hand-grading, when to alter scores, giving out test extensions, or other individual-level responses. Instead, we're going to focus on high-level approaches that will help the largest percentage of people and those in greatest need.</p>

<h3 class="hx-underline">Pre-Empting Problems</h3>

<p>There are only two kinds of problem: the kind that your learners complain about, and the kind they haven't run into yet. No, seriously, if they run into something and they're not complaining, it might not be a problem. </p>

<p>Let's focus on how to reduce student complaints.</p>

<h4 class="hx-underline"><span class="fa fa-question-circle"></span> FAQs</h4>

<p>Somewhere in your course, you should tell your students the basics. How long is the course, how much does the verified certificate cost, when are the deadlines, how much work is expected, what counts as cheating, etc. For some folks this goes into a Syllabus page; others build a separate FAQ page or a Course Policies page.</p>

<p>Don't go overboard. Do <em>not</em> try to answer your learners' every possible question in excruciating detail before they start. Hit the basics. If you've written more than 500 words, you've gone well past the basics.</p>

<p>No matter how many times you tell your learners when the homework is due, or how their grades are calculated, or how certificates work, they'll miss it. Then they'll ask you on the discussion boards. A lot. Telling them more times will not help. Telling people a thing does not ensure that someone learns that thing. <strong>Again for the people in the back: Telling People A Thing Does Not Ensure That They Learn It.</strong></p>

<p>You know what, why are we telling you this. Let's do it proper:</p>
