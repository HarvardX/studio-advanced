<h3 class="hx-underline">Introduction to the Prototype</h3>

<p>This prototype shows course design projects from several different sections of the course. It includes assessments and activities that you can work through as though you were a course designer taking this class. We anticipate that it will take you a total of approximately 1-3 hours to "complete" the module and fill out the survey, and we really appreciate your taking the time to "take" the module and provide feedback.</p>

<p>You are not expected to implement any of the projects that you see here, though you are welcome to do so if you like. Some of them may be outside of your interests or technological comfort zone. We ask that you focus on the <em>instructional design</em> of this prototype rather than on the specific topics represented.</p>

<h4 class="hx-underline">A few notes about the prototype</h4>

<p><em>Studio Advanced</em> is organized by the amount of time a project should take, rather than by topic. Since we're presenting a limited selection of the course content, it's a little bit out of context, and the projects you see here will take widely varying amounts of time.</p>

<ul>
  
  <li>The <strong>videos</strong> in this prototype are currently placeholders, which means that they are either just holding space or haven't been fully edited or polished yet. For now, though, they might look a little bit jumpy, and only a few have graphics or other visual effects added to them. For the final course, all of the videos will have some graphics and/or text, and the cuts will be smoothed out, but it isn't practical to finalize things at this stage.</li>
  
  <li>The <strong>icons</strong> that appear at the beginning of each project, to denote time and expertise, are placeholders. They will be replaced with a professionally designed set with a more unified feel and more reasonable color set.</li>

  <li>We are still exploring options for the <strong>"look &amp; feel"</strong> of the course. As you read the text and use the demos, please pay particular attention to these, and let us know what you think. Is there one style that you find particularly effective or ineffective?</li>

  <li>The <strong>assignments</strong> in this course are intended to be formative in nature, helping people gain a deeper understanding of the tools available. When you look over the assignments, please ask yourself: "Do I feel like I <em>want to know the answer</em> to this question? Would I try this question just to find out what the answer is?"</li>

  <li>This course would normally have <strong>discussions</strong> embedded on each page. We've left them out for the prototype.</li>
  
</ul>

<h4 class="hx-underline">Feedback</h4>

<p>There's a survey at the end of the prototype to gather your feedback, and we'll also set up a time to meet and discuss your experience taking the course, either in person or video chat. The feedback that we will ask for in the survey is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What did you learn?</li>
  <li>Did you feel like you could follow along with the items that were within or close to your skill set? Were the instructions and recommendations written in ways that you could understand?</li>
  <li>When you encountered something that was outside of your skill set, were you able to ascertain that quickly?</li>
  <li>Were you able to complete the assessments? Do you have any comments or feedback about the assessments?</li>
  <li>How do you feel about the approaches taken to explain the course content? Which do you feel were particularly effective, and why? Which seemed ineffective or felt shoehorned in?</li>
  <li>What did you like best?</li>
  <li>What would you change or improve? How?</li>
  <li>Would you take this course? Why or why not?</li>
</ul>
