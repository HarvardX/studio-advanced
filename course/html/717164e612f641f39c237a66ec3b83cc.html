<p>The edX discussion forum is notoriously... problematic. It becomes disorganized easily, moderation is difficult, and for some purposes it's just too clunky. Sometimes you just want people to share something they found.</p>

<p><strong>The goal:</strong> Build a way for learners to share links to cool stuff.<br/>
  <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Familiarity with HTML and Google Sheets.<br/>
  <strong>Project length:</strong> 30 minutes to learn, an afternoon to implement, 30 minutes to test.<br/>
  <strong>Ingredients:</strong> 
</p>
  <ul class="hx-tightlist">
    <li>A Google Form with a <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2917686?hl=en" target="_blank">spreadsheet to hold the responses</a>. You can do this with other survey tools, but they need to be able to publish a CSV file to the web.</li>
    <li>hx.js, hx.css, and hxGlobalOptions.js, which you can obtain from the <a href="https://github.com/Colin-Fredericks/hx-js" target="_blank">HX-JS repository</a>. Download them and put them in Files &amp; Uploads. </li>
    <li>You'll also want formtable_csv.js, and papaparse.min.js from the <a href="https://github.com/Colin-Fredericks/hx-js/tree/master/form%20to%20table" target="_blank">form to table</a> folder in that repo. These can also be dropped in Files &amp; Uploads.</li>

  <h4><span class="fa fa-warning"><span class="sr">Warning:</span></span> Google Is Not Forever</h4>
  <p>Right now we all basically think of Google as the eternal core of the internet. However, some day - maybe in a few years, maybe in a few decades - Google will go away, to be replaced by some other service. We're not totally against relying on external tools, you just need to be aware that you're doing it.</p>
