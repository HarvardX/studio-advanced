<p>So why are we making such a fuss about simple CSS? Take a look for yourself!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Below is a drop-down list of different elements that *could* be changed using CSS and their cataclysmic effect on the look and feel of a page when implemented. Try out the drop-down. You can press 'escape' to cancel any of the effects.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Questions to ask yourself as you toggle between the examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the impact on native edX design features?</li>
<li>Is the formatting applied consistently across the whole page?</li>
<li>Does anything else change that you hadn&rsquo;t anticipated?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>ENJOY! ;-)</p>
