<h3 class="hx-underline">Aren't basic questions boring?</h3>
<p>Simple answer, no.</p>
<p>We are all familiar with basic question types. These are the most common forms of assessment on almost every learning platform. Usually, this is where you pose a question to the learner and provide them pre-set answers to select from - traditional MCQ style. Numerical problems and check-all-that-apply problems fit into this box too. You might have already experimented with open text, short answers - requiring the learner to submit a specific word or numeral without explicit answers to select from - but it is possible to do a lot more with basic question types.</p>
