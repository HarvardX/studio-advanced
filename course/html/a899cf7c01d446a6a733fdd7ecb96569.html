<h3 class="hx-underline">How to spot rogue css changes</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Not all changes made through CSS will be as dramatic as our examples. Some changes can also have unintended consequences on other parts of the page, in subtle, almost unnoticeable ways. However, there are some typical clues visible on platform to help you troubleshoot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you are adding new HTML to your course, you should always test it out on one page before rolling out across the course. The more complex the HTML, the more testing required.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>These tell tale signs are a good indication something needs to be toned back or removed:</p>

<h4>CSS Checklist</h4>
<p>In preview and live - remember to check both in separate tabs and toggle between to compare</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Top site navigation bar changes</strong> - did the edX logo move? Is the happy little edX icon or your profile picture distorted?</li>
<li><strong>Loading time</strong> - is the page having difficulty loading or not loading at all?</li>
<li><strong>Unit navigation</strong> - are you able to press &lsquo;next&rsquo; or select the next unit logo just above the main text body?&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Site look and feel</strong> - is the text suddenly bigger/smaller than normal? Is the displaying font different?</li>
<li><strong>Did anything jump?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s common for changes to only be noticed once added to the platform. CSS viewers are great but give a clinical view of code - in a viewer, the code is not having to&nbsp;compete with all the other HTML&nbsp;built into the platform, so make sure you upload, check and update your code regularly during the&nbsp;development phase.</p>
<figure style="text-align: center; margin: 1rem auto 1rem auto;"><img width="80%" src="/static/css_marker.jpg" alt="Image of top navigation bar in edX with profile image highlighted" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /><figcaption style="font-size: 0.8rem; padding: 0.5rem;">This little guy can be a helpful guide - if he suddenly changes shape or moves in any way, you've probably done something silly. You'll also probably find your page navigation doesn't work either!</figcaption></figure>

<h4 class="hx-underline">What to do if you spot rogue changes</h4>
<p></p>
<p>When adding new CSS, check your page preview and live modes regularly to test implementation is as intended. If you notice something odd, go back to the last saved version of your CSS and focus on the most recent change. Do any elements need closing? What was the thing that changed on platform - does that provide a clue for your code?</p>
