<h3 class="hx-underline">Card Slider</h3>

<p>We've talked about <a href="/jump_to_id/9a8299914e364827bef20023b7bf2583" target="_blank">image sliders</a> elsewhere in this course, and even how they can be used for more than just images. So what more would you need to do with them?</p>

<p>Well.... what if you wanted an accessible replacement for an infographic? How about one with a visual overview of the connections between the slides? What if it also dynamically loaded each slide to save bandwidth? That's our card slider, and we'll show you how to make one.</p>

<p><strong>The goal:</strong> Build an interactive representation of dense, hierarchical information.<br/>
  <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Familiarity with HTML and Google Sheets.<br/>
  <strong>Project length:</strong> 30 minutes to learn, several days to implement, an hour to test.<br/>
  <strong>Ingredients:</strong> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A Google Sheet (or other source that can export a .csv file) based on this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qDkRPKh4Njk5ugiTyq1J7KatD-n-MZJH_v2eL57cvsA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">card slider template</a>. If you just want to test this out, you can use the template. When you decide to create your own, it's going to take some time.</li>
    <li>hx.js and hx.css, which you can obtain from the <a href="https://github.com/Colin-Fredericks/hx-js" target="_blank">HX-JS repository</a>. Download them and put them in Files &amp; Uploads. </li>
    <li>You'll also want hx-text-slider.css, hx-text-slider.js, and papaparse.js from the <a href="https://github.com/Colin-Fredericks/hx-js/tree/master/text%20slider" target="_blank">text slider</a> folder in that repo. These can also be dropped in Files &amp; Uploads.</li>
    <li>You need a bunch of icons for the graphical overview, one for each slide you have.</li>
  </ul>
