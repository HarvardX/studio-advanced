<p>Do you have loads of questions for assessments but only want to show a selection to learners? Or do you want to randomise questions to make a revision tool? Well, that is basically all you can do with content libraries! Do not be fooled, it is not a mixed media asset repository, and has a number of limitations, but if you want to use it in exactly the way it was designed, it works fine. </p>

<p>N.B.  Many institutions use externally built tools to randomise question sets as part of anti-cheat methods. If youâ€™re interested in this side, we recommend you take a look at <a href="/jump_to_id/2e7ff5cd623648868127d61151023aa6" target="_blank">2.6 Anti-Cheating Measures</a>.</p>
