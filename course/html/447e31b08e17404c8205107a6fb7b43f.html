<p>EdX is a great platform, but it isn’t necessarily the prettiest. Functional rather than fun - which in the majority of cases is exactly what most people need. However, the beauty of edX is that it allows you to add fancy bits through the ‘Raw HTML’ component. This opens up a whole host of opportunities for pretty designs and time saving shortcuts. CSS (cascading style sheets) can be a life saver, especially in more complex projects, so it’s worth getting familiar with its functionality.</p>

<p>In this section, we will introduce you to a few components that help make your pages pretty and life easier. However, it is not a comprehensive CSS course (there’s a whole internet out there of that stuff!). Think of this section as a starter's guide to falling in love with CSS.</p>
