<p>Content experiments, better known as "A/B testing" in the world of educational research, are a process for trying out new content and approaches. By giving certain learners one set of content, and other learners a different set, you can see which is more effective for specific purposes.</p> 

<p>EdX has built-in functionality for this sort of experiment. In fact, you've already seen one content experiment in this course: the end-of-project polls! Some people are seeing emoji responses, some people are seeing text responses, and some people are seeing alternating versions.</p>

<p>While edX content experiments are a little limited, they are very reliable, and we think that everyone should take advantage of them at least a little bit. In this section we'll talk about how you can build small experiments into your course without causing yourself a big headache.</p>

  <p>If you work at an academic institution, your Institutional Review Board may have things to say about you providing different content to different learners. Be sure you consult with them on the design of your study before implementing it.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Comfortable with edX Studio, and familiar with the basics of research study design.<br/>
  <strong>Project length:</strong> Expect the planning process to take several days. Time for implementation varies significantly depending on the exact research you plan to do.<br/>
  <strong>Ingredients:</strong> </p>
  <ul class="hx-tightlist">
    <li>This functionality is built into edX already - no extra code needed.</li>
    <li>For many research studies you will want to prepare multiple different versions of your content.</li>
    <li>You'll need a way to evaluate the effects of your study.</li>
  </ul>
