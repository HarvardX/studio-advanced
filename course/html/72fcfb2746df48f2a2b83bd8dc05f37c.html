<h3 class="hx-underline">Instructions</h3>

<p>Here's how to run the scripts.</p>

<p>First, open the .tar.gz file for your course and locate the resulting folder. It will probably be named "course".</p>

<p>Then, open up a command line and move into the folder that contains your script. Type <code class="lang-markdown">python3 NameOfScript.py</code> with no other arguments. That will give you the instructions for that particular script. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-markup"><b>HXColin:~ cfred$</b> cd Documents/GitHub_Repositories/hx-xml/
<b>HXColin:hx-xml cfred$</b> python3 SetMaxAttempts.py
usage: 
To use:
<b>python3 SetMaxAttempts.py number path/to/problem/folder</b>

Your options for the number are:
  - An actual number, which sets all problems to the same # of attempts
  - "delete" or "default", which removes the value so that
    course-wide default takes over
  - "auto" (recommended), in which case attempts are set as follows:
    - Numerical and Formula problems get 10
    - Customresponse and Text problems get 5
    - Checkbox problems get a number of attempts equal to the number of choices, max 5.
    - MC problems get...
      - 3 if they have 7+ options
      - 2 if they have 4-6 options
      - 1 if they have 2-3 options
    - Multi-problems get the highest number of the set.
    - Other problem types are skipped.

There will probably still be some issues, so you'll need to review.
This code will help you make a first pass, not a final pass.

SetMaxAttempts.py: error: the following arguments are required: number, directory</code></pre>

<p>Then, based on what you see in the instructions, you'll launch the script so that it works for you. In this case, if I wanted to automatically set the number of attempts allowed for every problem in my Statistics course, I'd write this:</p>

<p><code class="lang-markup">python3 SetMaxAttempts.py auto ~/Documents/Harvard/Statistics/backups/course/problem </code></p>

<p>Each script has its own set of instructions, so be sure to check for each new script as you run it.</p>

<h4 class="hx-underline">Once you're done...</h4>

<p>After you run the script, you need to tar and gzip the course folder. If you're on MacOS or Linux, you can type the following command into a terminal prompt (command line) to create your upload file:</p>

<p><code class="lang-markup">tar -zcvf newcourse.tar.gz course/ </code></p>

<p>After that you can upload it to edX via Studio's Import function.</p>
