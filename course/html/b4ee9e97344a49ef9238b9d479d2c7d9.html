<h3 class="hx-underline">No Live Demo, But...</h3>

<p>Because this is in Python, we can't easily give you a live demo online. You have to download the scripts and run them yourself. However, if you'd like to run the script on something other than your own course first, you should use the <a href="https://github.com/edx/edx-demo-course/" target="_blank">EdX Demo Course</a>! That course is stored on a public GitHub repo, and it has a little of everything so that you can test it out. If GitHub isn't up, you can <a href="/static/edx_demo_course.tar.gz">download the tar.gzip file here</a>, though we had to take out one or two things to get it to fit in Files &amp; Uploads.</p>
