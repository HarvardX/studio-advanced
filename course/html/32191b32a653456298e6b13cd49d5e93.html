<h3 class="hx-underline">Research-Based Methods</h3>

<p>If you'd like to learn more about how to create a great course, we've mostly delved into concrete advice and technical measures here. There are worlds and worlds of pedagogical research out there that we've scarecely touched.</p>

<p>One great way to start is by going to a conference, or, if you can't go, by reading the conference proceedings. Even if you don't find the exact paper you're looking for, you can often find references to fascinating work that people are doing in this field. Here are a few conferences we've attended and can recommend:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://learningatscale.acm.org/" target="_blank">Learning at Scale</a>, a small conference that talks about not just MOOCs but other large-scale learning.</li>
  <li><a href="https://solaresearch.org/events/lak/" target="_blank">Learning Analytics and Knowledge</a>, which handles large- and small-scale electronic learning.</li>
  <li><a href="https://linc.mit.edu/" target="_blank"> MIT's LINC conference</a>, which has presentations and workshops about many areas of modern education.</li>
  <li>For those of you more technically inclined, <a href="https://iaied.org/" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence in Education</a> or <a href="http://educationaldatamining.org/" target="_blank">Educational Data Mining</a> may be of interest.</li>
  <li>Many discipline-specific conferences also offer tracks that would be relevant. For instance, the <a href="https://www.aapt.org/" target="_blank">American Association of Physics Teachers</a> plays home to many educational researchers looking at online courses.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="hx-underline">Three Great Papers</h4>

<p>If you want to get started right away, here are three excellent papers for educational research. Reading these won't make you an expert, but they're a good first step on the path.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.3102%2F0034654317740335" target="_blank">How Do We Model Learning at Scale? A Systematic Review of Research on MOOCs</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.3102/0013189X14523038" target="_blank">Changing “Course”: Reconceptualizing Educational Variables for Massive Open Online Courses</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00461520.2014.965823" target="_blank">The ICAP Framework: Linking Cognitive Engagement to Active Learning Outcomes</a></li>
</ul>
