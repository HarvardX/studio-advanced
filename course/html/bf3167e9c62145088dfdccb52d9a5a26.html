<p>There are lots of different ways to build a survey… but we’re not going into that yet! The most important thing to establish first is ‘why are you conducting a survey?’ a.k.a what do you want to find out?</p>

<p>Surveys are standard research tools. They can be presented within a learner assessment context but typically stand alone as an instructor research opportunity. Polls and questionnaires can be used in much the same way but there are distinctions. The main difference between polls and questionnaires is the presentation of results back to the learners: polls reveal question responses and questionnaires typically do not. Polls produce quantitative data, whereas questionnaires can offer both quantitative and qualitative open response question types. And finally, polls are best for single questions and questionnaires allow lots of questions to be asked.</p>

<p>So back to the important question: what do you want to find out from your learners?</p>

<p>Surveys are used to gain insights into how people think or feel. There is no right or wrong answer. Even if you set up a poll to get a temperature check on learners’ confidence level on a topic, the primary purpose is to gain a snapshot insight into concept uptake rather than assign credit for a correct response. In this context, you would probably be asking to find out whether your course materials are doing their job or need revision to improve learner retention - the poll setup can be useful to show others feel the same and improve cohort cohesion.</p>

<p>Think carefully about the data you want to collect. </p>

<p>The format and framing of questions will have an impact on the data collected and response rates. People are typically more honest in their feedback if it is anonymous but if you need to know how their engagement with the platform correlates with a given survey response, making sure you can connect learner IDs with responses will be required. Unless specifically setup to integrate with edX through API/LTIs, external surveys will collect anonymised data.</p>
