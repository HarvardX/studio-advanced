<h3 class="hx-underline">Applications: Other Tricks</h3>

<p>This tool is really one of a whole class of "dumb internet hack" tricks that you can pull using various free providers and a little bit of parsing and/or display code. Here are a few related hacks that you might find useful.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Distributed Experiments:</strong> Embed a form in a science or statistics course, asking every learner to roll a die, or flip a coin, or do a quick experiment. Gather the data, build a graph, and publish that graph so you can embed it in the course. Learners can see the values changing every time they come back to the course, as more people enter their results.</li>
  <li><strong>Color a Map:</strong> The table trick is pretty easy in comparison to this one... so it's a good thing we built this one first! The <a href="https://github.com/Colin-Fredericks/hx-js/tree/master/datamap" target="_blank">datamap</a> folder in HX-JS will let you color a blank SVG world map based on country-by-country data in a CSV file. You can load specific data files, or you can have people fill out a form - though you might have to make a few extra sheets or write some extra code to do some processing for you. Special thanks to whomever made the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BlankMap-World6.svg" target="_blank">SVG world map on Wikimedia Commons</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Filterable Table:</strong> There's no reason you <em>need</em> to use a form in this setup. If you just want to show tabular data and let your learners filter it, you can save that data in SVG format and just use the bottom code block on the previous page. </li>
</ul>
