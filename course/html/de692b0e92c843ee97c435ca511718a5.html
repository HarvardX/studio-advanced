<p>In December 2018 edX instituted a new policy called <strong>Feature-Based Enrollment</strong> (FBE). In layman's terms, it's a paywall. In this section we'll talk about what's behind the paywall, what's not, and how you can build your course so that it fits within these restrictions. </p>

<p><strong>The goal:</strong> Explore the strategies for making the most of the edX paywall. <br/>
  <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> None.<br/>
  <strong>Project length:</strong> 30 minutes to learn, 20 minutes to implement, 10 minutes to test.<br/>
  <strong>Ingredients:</strong> n/a

  <h4><span class="fa fa-question-circle"></span> Why a paywall?</h4>
  <p>As a non-profit corporation, edX has always been supported by donations and partner fees (which vary depending on the institution). Verified Certificates provide another source of revenue. </p>
  <p>FBE was aimed at <a href="https://blog.edx.org/updates-platform-achieving-long-term-sustainability" target="_blank">improving the financial sustainability of the edX platform</a> by increasing the percentage of people who buy certificates. In other words, it helps edX make enough money to stay in business. While edX is still a non-profit organization that provides open-source code, this money pays for dozens of programmers, support staff, and administrative staff.</p>
  <p>EdX did consider other approaches to financial sustainability, such as puting the discussion forums behind a paywall (which they rejected). FBE was considered the best balance between "upsell" and free education. They continue to consider further options.</p>
