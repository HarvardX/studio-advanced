<h3 class="hx-underline">Sample Navigation Schemes</h3>

<p>Below you'll see a handful of alternative navigation schemes. Each of them is just a mockup. They're not hooked up to anything - you can't go anywhere by clicking on them. They're just wireframes. Take some time to look at each of them, and consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Can you immediately see how a learner would use it, or does it require explanation?</li>
  <li>Does its structure give you additional information beyond what's already in the course outline?</li>
  <li>Does the design have inherent accessibility issues?</li>
  <li>Do you like it?</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you've give it some thought, click on the "Our Analysis" button beneath each one to see what we think and why.</p>

<p>It's a long page. Feel free to skip around and see what you like best.</p>
