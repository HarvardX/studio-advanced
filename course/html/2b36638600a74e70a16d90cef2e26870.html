<h4 class="hx-underline">Reflection</h4>

<p>Itâ€™s important to reflect on the usefulness of interactives during each course review - if they are not quite hitting the mark or learners are still struggling to fully grasp the concept, it might be worth revising the delivery choice or position. If no one is engaging with the interactive component, no matter how long it took you to build, it is worth reconsidering the appropriateness of the asset.</p>

<p>Top tip: never put more than one interactive component per page, especially if you want learners to engage with it fully. If it's a particularly meaty activity, maybe give it its own page - this will nudge learners to pay more attention to your design decision, as they haven't been bombarded with content before and after.</p>
