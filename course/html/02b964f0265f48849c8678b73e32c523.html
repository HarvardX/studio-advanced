<h3 class="hx-underline">Link-Sharing Demo: The Form</h3>

<p>Here's the tool in action. We'll talk about how to build it on the next page.</p>

<p><i>You've seen links to some of our favorite resources already. Now it's time to share yours!</i></p>

<p><i>Use the form below to tell everyone what code, images, and tools you've used to create your courses. You can also use this to show off something neat you did, or to point at cool things you've seen in an edX course, whether on edX.org or elsewhere. Then check out the table below to see what everyone else said. </i></p>

<p><small><i>(Note: this form is for course creators to share cool stuff with each other. It's not for advertising. Don't make us delete your entry.)</i></small></p>
