<p>Did you know it's possible to add more to the home page than just a plain text announcement?</p>
<p>Did you know it's possible to add content such as images, videos and even reference your course CSS for branding consistency?</p>
<p>Did you know you can add glitter too?!</p>
<p>Well, the glitter is maybe pushing it but everything else is true! Your front page can celebrate all the beauty of your other course pages to welcome your new learners into a truly exciting learning experience. So what are you waiting for, bring on the shiny stuff!</p>
