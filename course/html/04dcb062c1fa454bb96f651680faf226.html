<ul>
  <li>Can you immediately see how someone would use it, or does it require explanation?</li>
  <li>Does its structure give you additional information beyond what's already in the course outline?</li>

<div class="hx-toggletarget-book" style="display:none;">
  <p>Here's what we think:</p>
  
  <p>This scheme is good for categorizing parts of your course. In fact, in many ways it's less of a "table of contents" and more of an classification scheme. If your learners can remember some detail about an item they're looking for, but not exactly where it is, this will be a great way for them to track it down.</p>
  
  <p>The use of color hasn't been well thought-out. The first thing in every list has the same color, and the second things are all the same color - there's no essential information conveyed or even reinforced there. It's better than having everything be the same shade of grey, but not by a lot.</p>
  
  <p>The interactive needs some help when it comes to UX. There's no obvious way to go back, and the "Reset" button doesn't help much. It also runs into issues on smaller screens, where text wrapping starts to take over. Fortunately, the accessibility is actually fairly good. Screen reader users can tab to every clickable element and activate them, and the focus moves appropriately.</p>
  
  <p>The worst problem with this scheme is that the lowest levels have no text. They're just images. You could give them alt text for a screen reader, but everyone else is stuck memorizing a large set of icons. You'd need to do a bit of redesign to add that back in, and it would probably lead to a very awkward-looking design.</p>
