  <h4>Suggested questions for the Syllabus Quiz</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>How is your grade calculated?</li>
    <li>How do you get to the next page?</li>
    <li>What are the homework deadlines?</li>
    <li>When will you get your edX certificate?</li>
    <li>When does this course release new material?</li>
    <li>What are good resources to use in this course?</li>
    <li>Which of the following are types of assignments in this course?</li>
    <li>Which of the following are acceptable ways to collaborate in this course?</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>That's how you do it. Give them a question about the material, and <em>make it count for points.</em> The practice of giving a <strong>Syllabus Quiz</strong> is probably the single best thing you can do in your course to cut down on unnecessary questions in the discussion board. When someone has to recall information, they're more likely to remember it later.</p>

<p>Give them about six to eight questions and move on.</p>

<h4 class="hx-underline"><span class="fa fa-search"></span> There's Never Too Much Testing</h4>

<p>No one wants to put out a sub-par class. Let's catch as many typos as we can, make sure all the problems are working properly, and touch up all the video transcripts <em>before</em> the learners see it. Let's do some beta testing.</p>

<p>The ideal beta tester is...</p>
<ul>
  <li>...a detail-oriented person,</li>
  <li>...with some content knowledge,</li>
  <li>...who is <em>not part of the original course team</em>. It's really difficult to edit your own work.</li>
</ul>

<p>The ideal beta testing period is <em>the same length as the course itself.</em> That way, someone dedicated to the job can go through the course at double speed, and you'll have time to fix the errors they find before the course actually launches.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="#TOCLink15">Track Issues</a> below for some ideas on how to be organized about this. You don't want to try to sort through a dozen e-mails, but you probably don't need a full-blown commercial project management system either.</p>
