<h3 class="hx-underline">Building your new CL</h3>

<p>Once you know what you want to build, what you want to include in the library and where youâ€™re going to put it in the course, setting up a content library is pretty straightforward. </p>

<p>The first step is to create a new library. It is really important to note that this sits <em>above</em> the course - this means you have to go to your studio landing page, rather than the course home page to create the library. Once set up, you can reference the library within your course. You can also add others in your course team to access and edit the library, if required.

<p>Remember to provide a meaningful reference for each library you set up, keeping in mind that this 'libraries' tab is a full inventory of every library associated with your courses. Whilst at the beginning you may only have libraries associated with one particular course, should you get a taste for content library use and want to use it on other course, a name such as 'Module 1' may be less useful when you have 16 courses all with a module-based structure! </p>

<p>Getting into the habit of using the unique course identifier in each content library code is a good way of reducing future ambiguity</p>

<p>Once you have created your new library, you can start adding html content blocks (assessment questions) to the library. The <a href="https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-partner-course-staff/en/latest/course_components/libraries.html" target="_blank">official edX docs</a> provide a good reference for adding and editing questions, troubleshooting and general setup.</p>
