<p>When surveyed about their academic habits, the vast majority of college students admit to cheating at some point in their academic careers. Typical numbers range from just under 60% to over 90%, depending on the survey, but averages have hovered around 75% ever since the first data came out on cheating in the 1960s.</p>

<p>Just like on-campus learners, MOOC learners can struggle with academic honesty. Our goal in this section is to help you better understand how learners cheat, and what sorts of approaches you can take to make cheating a little more difficult without harming honest students. No anti-cheating measures are foolproof, but we can at least hope to ensure some higher-quality fools.</p>

<p>If you're creating something that's more "experience" than "course", then all this might not matter to you. That's ok. Not everyone's verified certificate needs to be deeply meaningful. This section is aimed at the folks who want to create rigorous courses where earning a certificate is a sign of improved skills and mindsets.</p>

<p>
  <strong>The goal:</strong> Academic integrity.<br/>
  <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> It ranges, really. Anywhere from "none" up to "programming in Python", though not very much of that. <br />
  <strong>Project length:</strong> This is mostly an ongoing practice, employed while you build the course.
