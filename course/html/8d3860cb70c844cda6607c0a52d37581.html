<h4 class="hx-underline">A Cutaway</h4>

<p>This is a cutaway image, used as navigation in a (sadly hypothetical) course about the Space Shuttle. In real use, you would scroll around the image and click on locations or text in order to go to related pages. Here it's not linked, but you can still scroll about.</p>

<p>Remember the questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Can you immediately see how someone would use it, or does it require explanation?</li>
  <li>Does its structure give you additional information beyond what's already in the course outline?</li>
  <li>Does the design have inherent accessibility issues?</li>
  <li>Do you like it?</li>
</ul>

  <p>If you're teaching a class about the Space Shuttle, there's no nicer navigational aid than the Shuttle itself. However...</p>
  <p><em>This image is bloody tremendous!</em> Yes, the Shuttle is large, but there is no need to show it at practically 1:1 scale. Worse, it's fuzzy, because the original is not of high enough resolution. You can see the JPEG jaggies around each word.</p>
  <p>The "scroll your viewport" approach causes further problems because the visible area is small compared to the size of the image. It's possible for someone to miss one of the hotlinked areas entirely, just because they didn't "scrub" the image thoroughly enough. Don't take this approach unless you're intentionally making your course navigation into a scavenger hunt - which, unless you're making a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_game#Point-and-click_adventure_games" target="_blank">point-and-click adventure game</a>, is probably not your goal.</p>
  <p>There's also the issue of accessibility for clickable images, though that's handled easily enough by just making a list of links beneath the image.</p>
