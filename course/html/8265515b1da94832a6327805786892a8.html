<h3 class="hx-underline">Links for Gnurds</h3>

<p>You stuck around until <em>beyond the end of the course!</em> Hardcore, my friend.</p>

<p>For those still looking for more places to go with their explorations of edX, we present a small number of curated links. These are for the intrepid, the daring... and also for those who test before they deploy.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Colin-Fredericks/edx-undocumented/wiki" target="_blank">edX Undocumented</a>, the wiki for all of the cool features in edX that haven't made it to their official documentation. </li>
  <li>The <a href="https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/StanfordOnline/OpenEdX/Demo/course/" target="_blank">Stanford Demo Course</a>, which will show you a lot from their Open edX instance.</li>
  <li>The venerable and antique <a href="https://edxpdrlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html" target="_blank">edX Data Documentation</a>, which never moved beyond Version 0.1. Some of it still works, some of it doesn't.</li>
  <li>MIT's <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/ichuang/edx/latex2edx" target="_blank">latex2edX scripts</a>, which let you build an entire course completely in \(\LaTeX\). Includes open-source demo course.</li>
</ul>
