<h3 class="hx-underline">General Principles</h3>

<p>If you forget everything else, these principles will help your course run smoothly:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stay Organized.</strong> If you're wondering whether to write something down, keep track of something, or make a spreadsheet, the answer is probably "yes".</li>
  <li><strong>Recruit Help.</strong> Even if you can't hire an assistant, you can find people who want to help your course succeed.</li>
  <li><strong>Measured Response.</strong> Nothing is on fire. No one is going to die. If you're feeling rushed, take a breath, have a coffee, and ask around. When you fix a problem, do exactly what you need to do and no more.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, let's dig into the details. There are three categories of work for someone handling an ongoing course. First, we'll talk about reducing the number of problems you have to deal with. Second, we'll discuss discussions and how to keep them moving smoothly. Finally, we'll look at how to find and fix issues with live course material.</p>
