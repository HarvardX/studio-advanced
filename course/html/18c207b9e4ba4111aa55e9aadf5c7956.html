<p>Labeled diagrams are neat, but sometimes you want more than a single line of text. Maybe you've got a diagram of the cell and you want people to find out more about the parts, or an engineering diagram that explains why things were built the way they were. That's when you want a clickable image with pop-ups.</p>

<p>Clickable images are great for complex diagrams, but they have some of the same accessibility challenges. Your learners will still be able to get to the pop-ups with this approach, but your text will need to explain where in the diagram the object is.</p>
