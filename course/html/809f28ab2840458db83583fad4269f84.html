<h4 class="hx-underline">Things to note</h4>
<p>Admin privileges do not extend to content libraries. If a course contains a content library, admins of the course do not automatically gain access to this content library for edit or review. It is important to add more than one account to a content library for access should the main technology lead be away or unable to access their account at any time.</p>
<p>If you want to make changes to the content library once it has been populated with questions, you need to make the change in the content library directly, rather than in the course assessment component. You will lose any changes made if you edit via the course interface.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, it is a fairly restricted tool, but this can be very valuable in assessing whether it is the best fit for your needs. It is possible to add other HTML and video components to the library but the use-cases for this are few and far between. It is possible to consider it as part of a basic branching structure or A-B testing but as it is not possible to setup dependencies and the visibility of content viewed is more obscured than through using cohorts, the tool isn't particularly useful.</p>

<p>That being said, if you know of any creative ways this tool has been used on edX courses, we would be delighted if you could share in the discussion thread below!</p>
