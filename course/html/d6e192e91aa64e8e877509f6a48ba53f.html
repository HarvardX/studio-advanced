<h3 class="hx-underline">"Sticky" settings</h3>

<p>CSS on an edX page is "sticky" across the same subsection. What we mean here is that CSS loaded on one page will still be loaded on the next one. However, changes to a specific element's <code>style</code> attribute only apply to that element - even when you go back to the page.</p>

<p>When you want to make changes all across a course, it's best to use an external style sheet. When you want to change just one or two things on a page, a style attribute is best.</p>

<p>If you think that makes things hard to predict, you're right.</p>
