  <h4><span class="fa fa-warning" style="color:darkred;"><span class="sr">Warning:</span></span> Overrides</h4>
  <p>The Advanced Settings page says "Any policies you modify here override all other information you've defined elsewhere in Studio." <em>This is not always true.</em> In many cases, such as the items under "Assignment Settings (Individual)", the <em>local settings</em> are the ones that take precedence.</p>
  <p>For example, if your course is set to Show Answer: Finished, and an individual problem is set to Show Answer: Always, that problem's local rule wins. Even if you change the course-wide setting, that problem will still be set to Show Answer: Always.</p>
  <p>Be sure to test your settings changes to make sure they have the effects that you expect.</p>
