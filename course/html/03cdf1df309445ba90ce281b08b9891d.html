<p>Interactives can help keep content fresh and interesting. This does not mean you need to make everything an interactive activity. In fact, you should use these components fairly sparingly, so you do not fatigue learners, and instead emphasise their need to engage where it really matters. </p>

<p>On top of this, consider a choice of interactive to <em>complement</em> rather than distract from the learning. For example, a drag-and-drop interactive with 24 pairs to match may become a ‘game of speed and error’ rather than considered learning. Cognitive load and fatigue quickly kick in if there are too many variables to keep in mind. Similarly, an interactive that requires any ‘up-front learning’ or setup, digressing from the core learning proposition, will suddenly become a lesson in how to use that interactive tool! Keep things simple, with minimal distraction from the core purpose and learning will thrive.</p>
