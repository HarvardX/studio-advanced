<p>There will be times times when a digital platform cannot do what you want it to do, and so you reach to the HTML editor to expand the functionality repertoire available to you. But, if you find yourself copy-and-pasting chunks of code between pages multiple times, because you&rsquo;ve made something really useful, it might be worth considering developing a style sheet. This is particularly helpful when you&rsquo;ve developed a &lsquo;critical mass&rsquo; of HTML code chunks that you regularly reach for in your courses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply put, CSS is a method for standardising a style or approach of a given webpage, or a course in our case. CSS is the style and HTML the content. CSS uses HTML in the file for creating the style but then you use CSS short-hand references to streamline your in-page HTML code.</p>
<p>CSS comes into its own when creating more complex items in HTML, especially those with multiple lines of code. EdX doesn&rsquo;t really like lots of these complex code items on the page directly - the viewer interface can get a bit glitchy - so try not to overdo it!</p>
<p>Whilst the upfront work can be a little higher to get everything looking as you wish, it will save a lot of time in the long run and means you can tweak your design without having to manually change the code on each page.</p>

<h4 class="hx-underline">Pros and Cons</h4>
<h5>Benefits</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Saves time</strong>: once the .css file is referenced on page, you only need to use short references in your page editor to elicit the desired style</li>
<li><strong>Saves pain</strong>: any change to the core style sheet only needs to be made in the .css file, then uploaded again to edX, rather than manual changes to every instance of that style on your pages - the amended style 'cascades' across all pages</li>
<li><strong>Provides wide design scope</strong>: when HTML gets more complex, CSS provides improved operation and scope</li>
<li><strong>Improves load time of pages</strong> if they have lots of formatting enabled</li>
<li><strong>Improved accessibility</strong> through consistency of style and ability to test and make adjustments to all course pages</li>
<li><strong>Envy of all your friends</strong> as your course (and your code) will look awesome</li>
</ul>
<h5>Costs</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Upfront time required</strong> to work out the design features required</li>
<li><strong>New habit forming</strong>: it will feel a bit slow to begin with as you need to add new elements to each page as you make them</li>
</ul>
