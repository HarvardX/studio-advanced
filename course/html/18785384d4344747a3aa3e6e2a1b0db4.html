<h3 class="hx-underline">Demo: Single Carousel</h3>

<p>The example below is a revolving carousel of cute animals.</p>

<div class="hx-sliderbox">
<div class="hx-slider">
  <div><img src="/static/heimdall_bed_small.jpg" alt="Fluffy white-and-black cat in bed near radiator"/><p>This is Heimdall the cat. He can be seen in his comfy bed near the radiator, soaking up warmth.</p></div>
  <div><img src="/static/kymco_notplaying_small.jpg" alt="Tabby who is definitely not playing"/><p>Kymco the cat is certain that you did not catch her playing, because she is very serious and does not do that.</p></div>
  <div><img src="/static/rocket_tiny_small.jpg" alt="Very small black cat on floor"/><p>Rocket, a black kitten, is here pictured <em>not</em> playing, which is kind of strange for her.</p></div>
  <div><img src="/static/nebula_couch_small.jpg" alt="Small black cat napping on couch"/><p>This might look like it's Rocket, but it's actually her sister Nebula, fast asleep on a comfortable couch arm.</p></div>
  <div><img src="/static/greer_comfy_small.jpg" alt="Small dog on blankets"/><p>Greer the chihuahua is shown here in one of her favorite spots, on top of a blanket. It could be better if she were on a lap too.</p></div>
  <div><img src="/static/haggis_floor_small.jpg" alt="Extra-fluffy brown cat on mats on the floor"/><p>This is Pippa, also known as the Haggis. She holds the record for greatest concentration of fluff in the state of Massachusetts.</p></div>
  <div><img src="/static/greer_closeup_small.jpg" alt="Close-up of small dog under blanket"/><p>Lady Greer is ready for her close-up now. Being under a blanket is almost as good as being both under <em>and</em> on top of it.</p></div>
