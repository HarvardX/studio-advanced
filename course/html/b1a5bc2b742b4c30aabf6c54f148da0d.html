<h3 class="hx-underline">Example: Climate Change and Health Outcomes</h3>

<p>In HarvardX's course <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/health-effects-of-climate-change" target="_blank">The Health Effects of Climate Change</a>, much of the course revolves around complex interrelationships between a large number of factors in climate change research and human health outcomes. Some of this information is captured in the graphic below:</p>

<p>Even here, however, things have been substantially simplified. The graphic doesn't show the dense spiderweb of connections, only shows cause and effect as general left-to-right-trend, and omits the populations most affected by various changes in our environment. Accessibility is also a major concern, as concisely describing this network for the visually impaired is an exercise in futility.</p>

<p>Instead, the staff of that course built a card slider that shows the connections in a more interactive approach. We've included it below, along with the original instructional text from the course.</p>
