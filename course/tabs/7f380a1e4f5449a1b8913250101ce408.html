<h3 class="hx-underline">Links to Further Resources</h3>

<p>On this page we're encouraging everyone to share the resources, code, images, and tools they've used to create courses. You can also use this to show off something interesting that you did, or to point at cool things you've seen in an edX course, whether on edX.org or elsewhere. Check out the table below, then use the form to submit your own items. </p>

<p>The cells at the top of this table are filters. The rows underneath will change to match what you type. For instance, if you want HTML and CSS resources, type "CSS, HTML" in the Categories filter.</p>

<table id="responseTable" style="border: 1px solid grey;">
  <caption style="font-weight: bold; font-size: larger;">Link Sharing Table</caption>
</table>
<p><button id="reloadTable">Reload table data</button></p>

<p>Here's the form to add your own links:</p>

<p><small>(Note: this form is for course creators to share cool stuff with each other. It's not for advertising. Don't make us delete your entry.)</small></p>

<p>If you'd like to see the table with your submission included, press the "Reload table data" button above.  Sometimes our "data repository" can take a few minutes to update (and by "data repository" we mean "Google Sheets csv"), so please be patient. </p>

<p>Oh, and if you'd like to know how we did this, check out our project on <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+StudioAdv1+2T2019/jump_to/block-v1:HarvardX+StudioAdv1+2T2019+type@vertical+block@197cbcaab0aa419e9cc139e2339380b1">building a link-sharing form!</a></p>
