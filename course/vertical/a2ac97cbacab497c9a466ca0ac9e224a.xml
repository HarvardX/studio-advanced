Here are your major options:&#10;&#10;* If you want them to answer questions and *see what one another said*, you can use a [Poll](https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/open-edx-building-and-running-a-course/en/latest/exercises_tools/poll_question.html) (like this one!) or a [Survey](https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/open-edx-building-and-running-a-course/en/latest/exercises_tools/survey.html) (which is slightly more complex). &#10;* If you want them to give one another *feedback*, you have two options:  First, you can create an [Open Response Assessment](https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/open-edx-building-and-running-a-course/en/latest/exercises_tools/open_response_assessments/index.html) with a very *simple rubric*, perhaps with all the scores set to 1 point. This is great for rough drafts. Second, you can use the [Peer Instruction Tool](https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/open-edx-building-and-running-a-course/en/latest/exercises_tools/peer_instruction_tool.html) to ask quick questions and have learners share their *rationale* for their choice. This is great for concepts.&#10;* If you want them to *grade* each other's submissions, an [Open Response Assessment](https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/open-edx-building-and-running-a-course/en/latest/exercises_tools/open_response_assessments/index.html) is your only real option.&#10;* Finally, you can always ask them to post things in the discussion board." display_name="Peer Feedback" private_results="false" question="Would you like to have your learners give each other feedback on their work?
