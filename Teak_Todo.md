# TODO for Teak Revision

## General Notes

- Take the titles in this doc as the canonical ones. If the pages in the course have different titles, change them to these.

## Tabs

### Course page

- CSS in the Update section isn't working - the images should be smaller and arranged in a square.
- The dots are missing
- The xblock URLs aren't working, which is generally going to happen when the course moves servers anyway.
- Take into account the fold (which wasn't there in the old days).

### Links page

- We should probably move to a more curated sharing option for the links page, given that we're finally experiencing spam on edx.org.

### Key page

- Looks good!

## Welcome

### Welcome to Studio Advanced

#### Welcome and Survey

#### Navigation

### Navigation pages

#### Advanced Course Planning

- Come back to these for revision once we've pruned the sections they refer to.
- Oh hey where are the originals for these videos? We should put those somewhere that Open edX can own them.
- The videos also appear to not be loading.

#### Improved Operations

#### Short Projects

#### Long Projects

### Important pre-course survey

#### Pre-course Survey

- Ditch or replace this. This is from HarvardX, and we don't need to gather peoples' data.
