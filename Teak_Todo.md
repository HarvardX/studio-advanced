# TODO for Teak Revision

## General Notes

- Take the titles in this doc as the canonical ones. If the pages in the course have different titles, change them to these.
- âœ… Drop in new versions of [hx.js, hx.css, and helper files](https://github.com/Colin-Fredericks/hx-js).

## Tabs

### Course page

- CSS in the Update section isn't working - the images should be smaller and arranged in a square.
- The dots are missing
- The xblock URLs aren't working, which is generally going to happen when the course moves servers anyway.
- Take into account the fold (which wasn't there in the old days).

### Links page

- We should probably move to a more curated sharing option for the links page, given that we're finally experiencing spam on edx.org.

### Key page

- Looks good!

## Welcome

### Welcome to Studio Advanced

#### Welcome and Survey

- Polls seem ok. Check to see whether the emojis still work for accessibility purposes.

#### Navigation

- Not a huge fan of a single line of dots and squares; maybe we can switch this to two lines and more distinct shapes?

### Navigation pages

#### Advanced Course Planning

- Come back to these for revision once we've pruned the sections they refer to.
- Oh hey where are the originals for these videos? We should put those somewhere that Open edX can own them.
- The videos also appear to not be loading.

#### Improved Operations

#### Short Projects

#### Long Projects

### Important pre-course survey

#### Pre-course Survey

- Ditch or replace this. This is from HarvardX, and we don't need to gather peoples' data.

## 1 Advanced Course Planning

### 1.0 - Intro to Planning

(This is identical to the Advanced Course Planning navigation page and should stay that way.)

### 1.1 - Creating a style sheet

- **Summary:**
  - Switch references from "edX" to "Open edX"
  - Add notes about course-wide CSS
  - Why are the icons so huge?
- **Why bother?**
  - Make a prettier flowchart.
- **Demo:**
  - Put things closer together so you can see the changes when you make them, rather than having to scroll back and forth.
- **Code:**
  - Is CSS still "sticky"? I think this got fixed at some point.
- **Setup:**
  - Nicer flowchart
  - It's not named "Files & Uploads" any more.
  - Add notes for course-wide CSS.
  - Add suggested classes for targeting "just in Studio" or "just on live".
- **Test:**
  - Add course-wide CSS notes

### 1.2 - Selecting advanced problem types

- **Summary:** 
  - Harvard currently owns the JSInput Repo. (Transfer to Axim?)
- **Demo:** 
  - "Could not format HTML" on 4 out of 5 items here. Not great. Fix that. (Maybe just missing XBlocks? How do we design this page to account for deployments that don't have all of the blocks needed? Probably just a ToC with some extra details at the top.)
- **Code:** 
  - Update the zip file.
  - Check to make sure the links are current.
- **Test:** 
  - Check accessibility on emoji poll.
