# TODO for Teak Revision

## Tabs

### Course page

- CSS in the Update section isn't working - the images should be smaller and arranged in a square.
- The dots are missing
- The xblock URLs aren't working, which is generally going to happen when the course moves servers anyway.
- Take into account the fold (which wasn't there in the old days).

### Links page

- We should probably move to a more curated sharing option for the links page, given that we're finally experiencing spam on edx.org.

### Key page

- Looks good!

### Important pre-course survey

#### Pre-course Survey

- Ditch or replace this. This is from HarvardX, and we don't need to gather peoples' data.
